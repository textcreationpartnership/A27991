            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HER GRACE The Dutcheſs of MONMOUTH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere were anciently ſo many Noble Women, as well as Men, who, even then made the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Scripture their delight, when Chriſtian piety began to decay; that a great part of S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s pains was beſtowed in opening the meaning of them to <hi>Bleſilla, Marcella, Melania, Paula</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> with ſeveral other eminent Roman Ladies: <hi>whoſe Songs</hi> (as he writes to <hi>Aſella</hi>)
<hi>were nothing but Pſalms; whoſe diſcourſe was the Goſpel; whoſe pleaſure
<pb facs="tcp:99434:3"/> was continence; and whoſe life was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and abſtinence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly he addreſſed his ſervices of this kind, to the laſt of thoſe Ladies, <hi>Euſtochium;</hi> to whom he gives an Epithet, importing her prodigious induſtry, with the moſt fervent deſire, in the ſtudy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly knowledge: and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to her the moſt elaborate of all his Commentaries upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (as he did afterward thoſe upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) which were ſent her by parts in <hi>XVIII.</hi> Books; before every one of which there is a ſolemn Preface to her.</p>
            <p>By whoſe example, and to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that eſteem and love of Divine Wiſedom, wherewith, in an age of folly and vanity, God hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy inſpired your excellent mind, I have preſumed to dedicate to your GRACE this ſmall Work of mine;
<pb facs="tcp:99434:3"/> wherein, with no ſmall labour, I have expounded the moſt uſefull Book of the PROVERBS.</p>
            <p>Which commends it ſelf to your Grace's acceptance, both by the
<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the matter;</hi> containing (as the words are <hi>VIII.</hi>
6. <hi>XXII.</hi> 20.) moſt noble and princely things; choice Maxims, built upon the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obſervations, and that will ſtand firm and be found true, as long as the world endures: and from the <hi>dignity and ſplendour of the Authour;</hi> whoſe illuſtrious name and pedigree, is ſet down on purpoſe (as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> thinks) in the entrance of the Book, to give the greater Authority to his words.</p>
            <p>It is SOLOMON, to whom the Lord himſelf ſaid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> III. 12. <hi>Behold, I have given thee a wiſe, and an underſtanding heart, ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither
<pb facs="tcp:99434:4"/> after thee ſhall any ariſe like unto thee:</hi> And again, it is recorded of him there, <hi>IV.</hi> 29, <hi>that God gave Solomon wiſedom and underſtanding exceeding much, and largeneſs of heart, even as the Sand that is on the Sea ſhore.</hi> For as the Sand of the Sea incompaſſes all the Coaſts of this World wherein we inhabit; ſo did his Mind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things as well Humane as Divine.</p>
            <p>This is that Admirable perſon, to the ſtudy of whoſe rare Wiſedom I invite your <hi>Grace:</hi> which that it may be had in greater Veneration, the name alſo of his Mighty Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, ſaith the ſame S.
<hi>Baſil,</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the title unto his own: to put us in mind that he was the Wiſe Son of a Wiſe Father and Prophet, who from his infancy had inſtructed him in the holy Writings, and made him fit to ſucceed him in his Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99434:4"/> That likewiſe contributes not a little to the weight of theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Authour of them was a KING; and a
<hi>King</hi> in the holy City of God, whoſe Authority he had; which being a name of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and legal power (as the ſame <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſtill obſerves) it is manifeſt that the Precepts delivered by ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and one who was truly worthy of that high title of a <hi>King,</hi> are of the greateſt worth and moment: becauſe they have reſpect to nothing but merely the common benefit, and publick good; and cannot be ſuſpected to have been framed and compoſed with any aim at private intereſt. For that is the difference, ſaith he, between a <hi>Tyrant</hi> and a <hi>King:</hi> that the former hath regard onely to himſelf in all that he doeth and deſigns; but the other conſults the profit and welfare of thoſe whom he governs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99434:5"/> So that, in ſhort, this is the Work of him, who was truly inveſted with that threefold glory, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients aſcribe to
<hi>Triſmegiſtus; the power of a King, the illumination of a Prieſt, and the learning of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the excellence of this Book will be beſt underſtood by the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peruſal of it; which will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to be a Magazine of all ſorts of Wiſedom: <hi>ſo full of golden Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> (as King
<hi>James</hi> gives its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in his Inſtructions to his Son) <hi>and moral Precepts, in all things that concern our converſation in this world, as among all the prophane Philoſophers and Poets, there is not to be found ſo rich a Store-houſe of Natural Wiſedom, agreeing with the Will and Divine Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99434:5"/> And therefore it is moſt worthy the conſtant ſtudy of all perſons, who would accompliſh themſelves with the moſt uſefull knowledge: but of none more, than of thoſe that are Great, whom
<hi>Solomon</hi> inſtructs how to be Greater, and to make their Greatneſs alſo laſting and durable: and eſpecially of ſuch whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are Great and Capacious; able to penetrate into the depths even of the Civil Precepts and Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in this Book;
<hi>ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> (as our great Advancer of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpeaks) <hi>out of the moſt profound ſecrets of Wiſedom, and flowing over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large field of variety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which I am confident your <hi>Grace</hi> will delight to walk: whoſe exquiſite Judgment cannot but find the higheſt entertainment, in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wiſedom, as well as the Truth, and Uſefulneſs of theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables:
<pb facs="tcp:99434:6"/> and whoſe Vertue and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence diſpoſes the hours of your life with ſuch order, as not to let you want time, both to ponder them your ſelf, and to inſtill them alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mind of your Children.</p>
            <p>Whoſe future happineſs depends, upon their being early ſeaſoned with ſuch Principles as theſe: which will be the moſt effectual Preſervatives againſt the infectious air wherein we breathe: and a Treaſure of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price, as will keep their Minds from being corrupted, by all the briberies of Fortune (as we call it) or from being dejected at any croſs turn of it; which, in this world, muſt be ſometimes expected.</p>
            <p>For ſuch is the inconſtancy of all humane things, ſuch is the frailty even of our own bodies, as your Grace hath been lately taught by a tedious Sickneſs (from which I moſt
<pb facs="tcp:99434:6"/> heartily congratulate your Grace's happy recovery) that we love not our ſelves, if we ſeek not after a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Good, which is firm and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: a good that can withſtand corruption; and defend it ſelf againſt the force of time, and all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this World.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good, I commend your Grace to the bleſſing of the Almighty; who always favours the leaſt deſires of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and therefore will never deſert your ſincere indeavours of it: which are not unknown to Him, while you prefer the Cloſet to the Theatre, and look more to the inſide of Vertue, than to its outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</p>
            <p>But I forget my ſelf; and ſtand in need of a pardon for this long Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs: which I ſhall the more eaſily obtain, if your Grace pleaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:99434:7"/> nothing emboldned me to it, but the opinion I have that your Goodneſs is as unlimited as my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to approve my ſelf, what I ſtand bound by many obligations to be,</p>

<hi>Ethicks;</hi> correcting mens er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and teaching them how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct themſelves in all relations: but may as well be called his <hi>Politicks</hi> alſo, comprehending under that word, Rules for the Government of Families, Cities and Kingdoms as well as of particular Perſons. For, as S.

               </gap>, an univerſal inſtruction and direction for all men, and for the whole life: containing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

            <p n="2">II. And there being two ways of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; one by brief Sentences, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms,</hi> which are delivered alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly without any great care about the order of them; the other by
<hi>metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Diſcourſe,</hi> according to the Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> proceeding orderly from one thing to another, till all that belongs to the matter in hand, be reduced to one body, and make as it were an intire building:
<hi>Solomon</hi> hath choſen the firſt way, which was the moſt ancient; as it would be very eaſie to ſhew, were there any neceſſity of it; and were not the great Antiquity of this ſententious way of ſpeaking, apparent enough from that paſſage of <hi>David</hi>'s 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 13.
<hi>As ſaith the Proverb of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; wickedneſs proceedeth from the wicked:</hi> which is much like that Greek Adage

               </gap>. <hi>For</hi> it was very uſual with the Wiſe men of
<pb facs="tcp:99434:8"/> old (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves in his
<hi>Eighth</hi> Book of the <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) when their obſervation light upon any thing, that might prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial unto common life, to reduce it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and contract it, either into ſome <hi>ſhort ſentence</hi> or <hi>parable;</hi> or elſe into a <hi>Fable.</hi> As for
<hi>Fables</hi> they were onely the ſubſtitutes, and ſupplements of Examples; to ſerve inſtead of them, while they were wanting, and no longer: when the world abounded with <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> they became unneceſſary, becauſe the ſhadows of things are uſefull onely where the ſubſtance cannot be had; and becauſe the aim is more exact, and more pleaſant, when the mark is alive. Then thoſe <hi>Fables</hi> were to give place to this Sententious way of Inſtruction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing wiſe obſervations in a few words: which could be illuſtrated and inforced by a multitude of examples.</p>

Who ſaid indeed ſome pretty, ſpruce things, but ſo weak and ſhallow in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the manly and deep ſenſe of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proverbs; that they were fit onely for the uſe of Nurſes to prattle to their Babes; or at the moſt for Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogues to teach little Boys. There is not, for inſtance, ſuch a wiſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be found in all their Books, as the very firſt of all in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, which he lays as the ground of all wiſedom
<pb facs="tcp:99434:9"/> (but they alas! did not think of) that <hi>the Fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wiſedom.</hi> This as <hi>S. Baſil</hi> obſerves, is that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            <p>The like I might ſay of another moſt admirable Precept in this Book, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſoul for wiſedom, viz. <hi>truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding.</hi> There is no ſuch word in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; nor in <hi>Iſocrates</hi> neither (whom that Apoſtate Prince vainly magnified likewiſe above
<hi>Solomon</hi>) who may be praiſed for ſome profitable leſſons he gave to youth, but muſt ſtoop, as S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi> ſpeaks, to this great perſon; who as he wrote long before him, ſo far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
<pb facs="tcp:99434:10"/> him in all ſort of wiſedom, for the inſtruction both of young and old. Nor doth he onely give precepts of manners, but many excellent admonitions about rewards and puniſhments: together with lively deſcriptions of the events of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions; which ſerve much for our information. Many things alſo he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers of mens moſt ſecret affections; of the cauſes and grounds of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt changes in humane affairs; of the principal things, that are of greateſt moment in Government; of the way to avoid all manner of dangers, and to preſerve our ſelves, our fame, our eſtates: with ſo many other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Son of <hi>Syrack</hi> juſtly ſaid of him XLVII. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 14, 15.
<hi>He was as a floud filled with underſtanding. His Soul covered the whole earth, and he filled it with dark Parables.</hi>

<hi>Prolegomena</hi> to <hi>Stobaeus</hi>) that the moſt ancient Authours delivered their precepts about manners, or about go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by

            <p n="5">V. But <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sentences in this Book are not of this Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:99434:11"/> the LXX. uſe another word, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a ſaying as trite and common as the high way; worn, as we ſay, thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare (to uſe S.
<hi>Baſil</hi>'s phraſe) by every bodies conſtant uſe. And ſo doth the <hi>Latin</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>Proverb,</hi> denote ſome ancient common Saying, which every body hath in his mouth. But the word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> denotes onely <hi>any acute and excellent Saying; which is as worthy to be known by all, and to be in every ones mouth, as common Proverbs are.</hi> And thus it is uſed in the moſt ancient Book of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, for <hi>an eloquent ſpeech,</hi> much exceeding thoſe that had been made before; in the beginning of the XXVII. and XXIX. of <hi>Job.</hi> And ſo the Doctours of the Church explain it. <hi>A Proverb,</hi> ſaith S.
<hi>Baſil, is a profitable Saying, delivered with a moderate conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſenſe,</hi> &amp;c. or a pithy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; in a few words expreſſing much ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99434:11"/> This is the firſt ſignification of the word: though in after-times, every Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was never ſo little out of the way of vulgar ſpeech, began by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to be called
<hi>Maſhall;</hi> as may be ſeen in XX. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 49. And whether it was figurative, or ſimple and plain, if it did contain any profitable Inſtruction, it was called by the ſame Name; as we learn from the Sentences in this Book.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Which conſiſts of a <hi>Preface,</hi> and of the
<hi>Book</hi> it ſelf. The <hi>Preface</hi> is in the <hi>nine</hi> firſt Chapters: <hi>ſeven</hi> of which ſeem to be an Admonition what is to be done, and what to be avoided, to make a man capable of Wiſedom: which in the
<hi>eighth</hi> and <hi>ninth</hi> Chapters ſets forth her own praiſes.</p>
            <p>Then begins, as you find in the front of the <hi>tenth</hi> Chapter, the <hi>Proverbs of Solomon:</hi> which conſiſt of <hi>three</hi> Parts, or Books. The <hi>firſt Part</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Xth Chapter, to the 17th verſe of the XXII. where a new form of
<pb facs="tcp:99434:12"/> ſpeech, any body may diſcern, begins (as I have there noted) and continues to the XXVth Chapter: which may be called the
<hi>ſecond Part.</hi> And then from the XXVth to the XXXth (which is the
<hi>laſt Part</hi>) follow ſuch Sentences as were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected afterwards out of his Writings, or the Writings of thoſe who had recorded them; by ſome perſons whom <hi>Hezekiah</hi> employed to ſearch the ancient Records. For we are told in 1 <hi>King.</hi> IV. that he ſpake in all <hi>three thouſand Proverbs:</hi> which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſeems to think were ſo many Books that periſhed in the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; but S. <hi>Hierom</hi> takes for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sentences contained in this Book: that is, ſome of them, for there are in all but 800 verſes. And ſome of them are not <hi>Solomon</hi>'s; for in the end of the Book are added certain Sayings of <hi>Agur</hi> to his Scholars, and the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a pious Mother to her Son <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel:</hi> of all which I have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in their proper places.</p>

And therefore muſt intreat all thoſe that would profit by this Book to reade the <hi>Argument</hi> of each Chapter, before they proceed to the <hi>Paraphraſe:</hi> or at leaſt to conſult the <hi>References</hi> which I have made to ſuch paſſages in it, as will help to make the ſenſe clearer, or to explain difficult places: which ſometimes are capable of more ſenſes than one; and therefore if I have not repreſented them all in the <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> I doe it in the
<hi>Argument:</hi> deſigning all along this alone, to give the fulleſt and propereſt explication of every phraſe; upon which as I have not dilated, ſo I have expreſſed the meaning in the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt words, I could find. For as Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks concerning his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> (in the Preface to the Vth Book) <hi>my buſineſs was not to ſtudy the Art of Rhetorick, nor of exact compoſition, and gracefull language; but to uſe a carefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to hit the ſenſe: reſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="tcp:99434:13"/> with this praiſe alone, if the Wiſe-man's words be underſtood by my means.</hi> And indeed it ought to be the deſign of every good man, in ſuch Works as theſe, that the Holy Books (as he ſpeaks in another place) <hi>may be made more intelligible and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable by his endeavours; and not that his own Writings may be commended, by occaſion of thoſe Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And in his time nothing was commended, he ſaith, but onely that which men fancied to be Eloquence. In this the <hi>Latins</hi> were then altogether delighted; but nauſeated the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Holy Scriptures. Which provoked God, in his juſt judgments, to deliver them into the hands of thoſe rough Nations, who, in his days, broke in like a floud upon them; and turned their vain affectation of neatneſs and elegance of ſpeech, into rudeneſs and Barbariſm: which ought to be a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:99434:13"/> unto us, not to give up our ſelves, to the admiration onely of the language and of the wit of the Stage; leſt our minds thereby be ſo depraved, that we have no reliſh of the moſt ſerious, no not of the ſacred Writings, but reject them as inſipid things: with which diſeaſe if any be infected, they might, by God's Grace, be cured; if they would be pleaſed to apply their mind, with due attention to the ſtudy of this one Holy Book: which wants nothing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the minds of all men, though of the wideſt capacity, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt variety of pleaſure; if they have not perfectly loſt their taſte, of that which will doe them good, and make them truly happy.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is recorded by <hi>Suetonius</hi> of <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> that in his reading all ſort of Greek, as well as Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, he chiefly obſerved, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſuch wholſome precepts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, as might ſerve him either for
<pb facs="tcp:99434:14"/> publick or private uſe: which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he produced, for the Inſtruction of his own domeſticks, or of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his Armies, or the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces, or the Magiſtrates in his ſeveral Cities; according as he thought every one had need of Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: whom if any man have the heart to imitate, <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſaved him the labour, which that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon underwent. He need not turn over many Volumes, to ſearch for all manner of wiſe inſtructions; but be furniſhed here (and that at an eaſie rate) out of the vaſt treaſure of Learning, he hath left us in this ſmall Book, with the beſt Advices that can be given, either to Princes, Counſellours, Judges, and other publick Miniſters; or to all ſorts of Subjects in their ſeveral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in every condition: to make them both pious and politick: to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the choice of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts; in the education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; in the management of domeſtick
<pb facs="tcp:99434:14"/> affairs, and in their tranſactions with other men; in contracting or conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Friendſhips; in giving or taking good counſel and reproof; in making or preſerving peace; in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, and of the event of their deſigns; and in ſhort (for it would be a new Book to mention every thing particularly) to inſtruct every one in all ſorts of vertue; eſpecially in the Government of the Tongue: wherein men offend, and whereby they ſuffer ſo much, that there is no part of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more neceſſary than that, and therefore none more inſiſted on in this Book.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Which contains the Wiſedom of that excellent Prince, who could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reſolve all Queſtions and doubts; penetrate into the nature of all things; and had his own Family and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in ſuch admirable order, that it aſtoniſhed her who came from the ends of the earth, to diſcourſe with him.
<pb facs="tcp:99434:15"/> And it was compoſed, if we may rely upon the judgment of the Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in his beſt and moſt judicious years; when his Kingdom alſo was in perfect peace, and there was no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in his affairs.</p>
            <p>For the Book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſay they, was wrote in his youth; the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> when he was of riper years; the
<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes</hi> when he was old, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ſins he had been drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the ſnares of Women: who had made this Admirable perſon, as great an example of folly, as he had been before of wiſedom: whence that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying of theirs; <hi>men compoſe Songs, when they are young, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, when they are grown to be perfect men; and Diſcourſes of the vanity of things when they are old.</hi>

<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> ſaith he, is an Inſtruction of manners, and a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the paſſions; and an intire direction of the whole life, containing abundance of precepts about well-doing.

The <hi>Song of Songs</hi> ſhews the manner of perfecting Souls. For it contains the happy concord of the Bridegroom and the Spouſe: that is, the familiarity of the Soul, with God the WORD."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. I conclude this Preface, as that Great man doth that diſcourſe.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He is wiſe, not onely who hath arrived at

Such as theſe, by the reading of this Book, ſhall be made wiſer; for they ſhall be inſtructed in much Divine, and in no leſs Humane learning: it expelling Vice divers ways; and, with as great variety, introducing all manner of Vertues.

                  <p>The Title of this Book is joyned to it, as a part of the work, and contained in the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt verſes. Where the Authour uſes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral words to expreſs the matter he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to treat of, <hi>viz. Wiſedom, Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Underſtanding, Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. the difference of which I have expreſſed as well as I could in the Paraphraſe, and ſhall not here criticiſe upon them. But obſerve rather that the learning they teach is the moſt neceſſary of all other; and therefore ſo contrived, as he tells us, that the moſt Ignorant as well as the moſt Wiſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99434:18"/> In order to which, the firſt principle of it muſt be carefully obſerved; which is this: [a] that <hi>a due ſenſe of God is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification to profit by theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions;</hi> which will ſignify nothing to <hi>Epicures,</hi> and ſuch like profane perſons. This is the very firſt word of the Book
<hi>v.</hi> 7. teaching us, that our firſt care muſt be to poſſeſs our minds with a lively ſenſe, that there is a God; and that the higheſt Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the World is to ſtudy to pleaſe Him, and to know what will pleaſe Him; and to be fearfull to offend Him, by any neglect of Him, or by doing any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Will. Which <hi>fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God</hi> is commonly founded in a dread of his puniſhments; which perhaps gives the firſt riſe to this fear: however <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> well obſerves (Orat. XXXIX. p. 628.) that we <hi>muſt not,</hi> if we would be wiſe, <hi>firſt begin in Contemplation, and ſo end in Fear; (for an unbridled Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation is very dangerous) but being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſeaſoned and purged, and as one may ſay attenuated, and humbled by Fear, ſo to be carried aloft in Contemplation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt ſtep to Wiſedom, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is;
[b] <hi>next to God, to bear a great reverence to Parents,</hi> both natural and ſpiritual: to God's Miniſters, that is, and to all Teachers and Inſtructors; to whom if Children be not bred to give a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99434:18"/> great regard, they ſeldom prove vertuous.
<hi>v.</hi> 8. Where it is very obſervable how much Humane Laws differ from Divine: the former generally onely providing that due regard be given by Children to their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but taking no notice of <hi>Mothers;</hi> as may be ſeen in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Laws mentioned by
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> deſcribed in the Digeſts and Conſtitutions, and ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Greek Philoſophers, which we find in <hi>Epictetus</hi> and <hi>Simplicius,</hi> who (as <hi>Grotius</hi> notes upon the <hi>Fifth</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) conſult onely the honour of the
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> but God in his Law takes care to preſerve a juſt reverence both to <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> equally; as the perſons whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry He uſes to bring us into the World. And accordingly not only <hi>Solomon</hi> in this place and many other, but the Son of
<hi>Sirach</hi> alſo (who was bred under that Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) preſſes the duty oweing to both very largely; in the firſt
<hi>ſixteen</hi> verſes of the <hi>III.</hi> of
<hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now one of the firſt things <hi>Parents</hi> ſhould take care of, is to teach their Children [c] <hi>to avoid evil Company</hi> (as it follows here <hi>v.</hi> 10.) and then to repreſent Vice in its true colours, as <hi>Solomon</hi> here doth one ſort of wickedneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the root of which he ſhews is <hi>love of money:</hi> which therefore ſhould be lookt upon as moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and indeed the root of all evil, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99434:19"/> Their ſtupid blindneſs alſo is to be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who will take no warning: but though deſtruction be plainly before their eyes in the way wherein they are; yet will go on to complete their ruin, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>And they are to be admoniſhed alſo to hearken to the voice of Wiſedom preſently, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they meet with it: which is every where, <hi>v.</hi> 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is preſſed here (<hi>v.</hi>
24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) from this conſideration, that there will be a time when they ſhall ſtand in need of God's help; but not find it, if they have ſlighted his importunities to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For He is not onely good but juſt alſo: and not ſo eaſy, as to be moved merely by Prayers and Intreaties (and that when we are in diſtreſs) which have more of ſelf-love in them, than love to Him. Whoſe wiſe Providence requites men in their kind; and deſtroys them by that which they moſt deſire.</p>

                  <p>The attention of thoſe that reade this Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſpoke in the foregoing Chapter, He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them not onely to reade but to receive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99434:27"/> and obey theſe good Counſels; by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the benefits of being wiſe, that is, good and vertuous; and the miſchiefs a man ſhall thereby avoid. The chief is, that he is ſure to be under the guidance and bleſſing of God; who will impart more and more of himſelf to thoſe that ſtudy Wiſedom; which is the ſcope of the former part of this Chapter: and as on the contrary, if he do not order his ways by the rules of Wiſedom he is ſure to wander moſt dangerouſly, ſo if he keep cloſe to them they will preſerve him from utter ruin; which is the deſign of the latter part of it. Where under the figure of an <hi>Adulterous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> v. 16. ſome think he perſwades us to ſhun all thoſe [a]
<hi>Doctrines</hi> which draw away the mind from God; ſuch as thoſe of the
<hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curaeans</hi> and <hi>Idolaters.</hi> But I take this to be intimated before <hi>v.</hi> 12. and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him literally: and then he ſeems to give a caution, againſt the breach of the next Commandment to that mentioned in the firſt Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. where he charges his Son by no means to conſent to joyn with <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> and here to ſhun
<hi>Fornication and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> which alienate the mind quite from Wiſedom, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is one of the firſt things Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom directs us unto, and a principal benefit we receive by it; <hi>to preſerve our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings from being corrupted, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Bodies pure and undefiled.</hi> For too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99434:27"/> many, giving up themſelves to fleſhly Luſts, are thereby wholy perverted, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves: but live and die like Fools.</p>
                  <p>And one of the next points of Wiſedom is, [b] to be taught by the dear bought experience of others; who have been ruined Body and Soul, by thoſe leud Courſes to which we are inticed. And here the wiſe Man leads us back as far as the Old World: which was wholy deſtroyed by ſuch vilanies as mens bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Luſts and Paſſions carry them to commit. This ſeems to be implied in the word <hi>Repha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> v. 18. (concerning which ſee Mr.
<hi>Mede,</hi> p. 42.) who being abominably debauched themſelves, had corrupted the reſt of the World: ſo that there was no way left to purge it, but by extirpating the whole race of Mankind; except the Family of

Firſt, our own <hi>diligence;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>dependence upon God for help and aſſiſtance;</hi> thirdly, <hi>a due value of that which we ſeek;</hi> fourthly, <hi>avoiding ſuch things as will plainly ſeduce us;</hi> and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>putting in practice what we know,</hi> that we may know more: for want of which many learned Men have proved worſe than the moſt ignorant. Moſt of theſe are the ſenſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99434:28"/> of the beginning of the Chapter; and the laſt of them is the ſenſe of <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And to make his Exhortations the more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, he acquaints the Reader with the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which his own Father and Mother were wont to teach him (<hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and the great benefit he had received by them. Which gave him the greater confidence to preſs every one to follow his example of obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs to good counſels, as the ſureſt way to be happy: and by no means to imitate the examples of the wicked, from which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades by many arguments (<hi>v.</hi> 14, 15,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and beſeeches they may be ſo duly pondered (<hi>v.</hi>

                  <p>There being nothing to which Youth is ſo prone, as to give up themſelves to ſatisfy their fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, and nothing proving ſo pernitious to them, if they doe it with Harlots; the Wiſe Man gives a new caution againſt thoſe impure Luſts, which he had taken notice of before (<hi>ch. II.</hi> 16, 17, &amp;c.) as great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99434:46"/> to Wiſedom: and with repeated intreaties begs attention to ſo weighty an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which here he proſecutes more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and preſſes not onely with ſingular ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, but with powerfull reaſons. Which in the heat of youth men are not forward to conſider; but if they would be ſo ſober, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hath ſaid enough to deter them from whoredom.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe miſerable effects he deſcribes by ſeveral apt reſemblances (<hi>v.</hi> 4, 5,) which ſhew how, by this vice, men loſe their honour, their time, their health, and eſtates; and at laſt (as he ſhews afterwards) lie down in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and end their days in an unprofitable repentance. And therefore, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, he commends the uſe of marriage, and a paſſionate love for a man's own Wife; which he deſcribes allegorically: <hi>firſt,</hi> [a] under the compariſon of a <hi>domeſtick foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> where a man may quench his natural thirſt, and from whence <hi>ſtreams</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) may be derived abroad to ſerve the publick good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<hi>ſecondly,</hi> under the compariſon of a <hi>young Hind</hi> and a
<hi>young wild Goat;</hi> which are taken notice of by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours that write of Animals (particularly <hi>Oppianus</hi>) to be loving Creatures: and which in ancient times were playfellows (as one may call them) for the greateſt perſons, who kept them in their palaces, and diverted themſelves with them, as a lovely ſort of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99434:47"/> Creature, whom they delighted to adorn with Chains and Garlands and ſuch like things. About which <hi>Bochartus</hi> among others may be conſulted: who hath demonſtrated that the
<hi>Jaalah</hi> (which we tranſlate a <hi>Roe</hi>) is a Creature that lived in mountainous places, and could climb up the ſteepeſt Rocks. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which, as well as to a <hi>young Hind, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> compares a good Wife, becauſe of the ſimplicity, ſoftneſs, good nature of this kind of Creature; and other qualities mentioned by ancient Authours. Who abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us, what reaſon the Wiſe Man had to make choice of theſe compariſons, to repreſent the pleaſures of ardent love between Man and Wife; when it is natural, without conſtraint; ſincere, ſimple, gentle, without moroſeneſs, ſuſpicions or pride: which good qualities are not to be found in Harlots; but may be met withall in a Wife. From whence he ſhews the unreaſonableneſs, nay unaccountable folly of preferring fornication and vagrant luſts, before the innocent joys of a married life (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) to which a man, who conſiders his own good, would chuſe to be tied that he may avoid the inconveniencies or rather miſeries to which the luſts of uncleanneſs reduce him: but eſpecially the heavy judgment of God; who having ordained marriage for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Mankind and the preſerving ſociety (<hi>v.</hi> 21, &amp;c.) will not therefore let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it go unpuniſhed.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99434:53"/> to ſtarve; laying up in ſtore, by a notable induſtry, ſufficient proviſion in due ſeaſon againſt a time of need.

<hi>whoſe onely care it is to live upon the main ſtock; but not to improve it by ſowing the ground of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over again, and reaping a new harveſt.</hi> This is the ſum of the <hi>eleven</hi> firſt verſes.</p>
                  <p>And upon this occaſion he annexes the deſcription of a deceitfull knave (<hi>v.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) who cares not by what wicked arts he lives, when he is reduced to poverty. Whoſe character he gives from his <hi>mouth,</hi> his <hi>eyes, feet, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, heart</hi> and

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents as moſt odious to God, he returns to his former Argument; to give cautions againſt uncleanneſs, eſpecially

11. upon which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made a very ingenious obſervation; diſtinguiſhing in this manner, between the <hi>poverty that comes as a Traveller,</hi> and the <hi>want that comes as an armed Man:</hi> that the <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of fortune falls upon Prodigals or ſuch as are careleſs of their Eſtates, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99434:54"/> degrees at the firſt; with ſoft ſilent paces, like a Traveller, and is hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: but ſoon after Neceſſity invades him, like an armed Man: that is, preſſes upon him ſo hard, that he feels it plainly, and perceives there is no reſiſtance to be made.</hi> And thereupon he gives this prudent advice, to <hi>prevent the Traveller, and to be well provided againſt the armed Man.</hi> But it is ſufficient to have noted this here, (out of his Eighth Book of the

                  <p>Chaſtity is a vertue of that conſequence, and Impurity ſuch a pernicious bane of Youth; that the Wiſe Man thought he could not too oft make mention of the danger of the one, to move men carefully to preſerve the other. And therefore is not contented with what he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99434:62"/> had already ſaid about this matter, in the latter end of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter, and in the whole
<hi>fifth</hi> Chapter, and now in the latter part of the <hi>ſixth:</hi> but again repeats it with renewed importunities; deſiring to be heard attentively, eſpecially in the cautions he gives againſt <hi>Adultery;</hi> the avoiding of which he repreſents as a high point of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>And the better to ſecure thoſe that deſire to be happy from this ſnare, he repreſents, together with the ſillineſs of young Men, the cunning and crafty devices of an impudent Adultereſs. Which is admirably ſet forth from <hi>v.</hi> 6. to <hi>v.</hi> 21. Where he begins to ſhew the effects of her courtſhip, and its lamentable concluſion. And thereupon <hi>v.</hi> 24. renews his intreaties to beware of ſuch Women; who have undone many and great perſons; and to ſtop at the very firſt motion or inclination towards her.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is, that it is a <hi>ſingular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> a man hath by true Wiſedom, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ſuch ſins and ſuch miſeries: And therefore we ſhould <hi>ſtudy Wiſedom;</hi> which alone can ſecure us from being deceived by ſuch flatteries, as bewitch ſilly and incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Souls to their ruin. And herein the <hi>vigilance of Magiſtrates</hi> is required to watch and obſerve (as <hi>Solomon</hi> did
<hi>v.</hi> 6. 7.) the manners of their Subjects; that they may the better obviate and correct their vices: but eſpecially <hi>every man's diligent conſideration</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:99434:62"/> is neceſſary, of ſuch things as
<hi>Solomon</hi> here ſets before him to divert him from ſuch wicked courſes. Particularly the <hi>character of theſe leud women is to be ſtudied;</hi> who are then moſt abominable, when they put on the mask of piety and devotion. As this ſtrumpet doth (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) in her ſpeech which ſhe makes to the young Man. Where there are two things in my Paraphraſe, of which I owe ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>[a] The one is in the beginning of it, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Where I have taken <hi>Schelamin</hi> peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, of which there were
<hi>three</hi> ſorts (VII. <hi>Lev.</hi> 11, 12. 16.) for the laſt of them, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of <hi>thankſgiving</hi> for bleſſings already obtained; not of <hi>prayer</hi> for the impetration of bleſſings from God (as
<hi>Grotius</hi> and others underſtand the word) not yet received. My reaſon is, becauſe ſhe was ſo ſolicitous to have company at her feaſt upon this Sacrifice, that very day. Every body knows that ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were to be of the beſt, either of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,</hi> or
<hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Goats</hi> (III. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1, 6, 12.) and that the greateſt part of them fell to the ſhare of the perſon who offered them, that he might feaſt with God: that is, all except the fat upon the kidneys, and rump of the Sheep, and the breaſt and right ſhoulder; which was ſufficient to make a liberal enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for his Friends. But this is not ſo commonly obſerved, that though they might keep this fleſh two days, before it was all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99434:63"/> ſpent, becauſe there was ſuch plenty of it, yet that is to be underſtood onely of the <hi>two firſt</hi> ſorts of Peace-offerings, for obtaining bleſſings; not of the
<hi>euchariſtical,</hi> or Thank-offerings: which as <hi>Philo</hi> obſerves, were to be eaten the very ſame day they were offered; <hi>that they who had readily received favours from God, might as readily, and without delay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to others.</hi> Which is the account <hi>Abarbinel</hi> alſo gives of this matter: and it is obſervable, that all ſorts of bread were to be joyned with this Sacrifice, that every thing might be ready for the Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>[b] The other thing is at the latter end of her ſpeech,
<hi>v.</hi> 20. where by the word <hi>Haccéſe</hi> I underſtand the
<hi>Full Moon,</hi> as the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> doth. With which Tranſlation Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters find fault, becauſe it looks like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, they ſay, to call that day by a name, which ſignifies the Moon <hi>to be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi> and therefore they tranſlate it rather the <hi>New Moon,</hi> as we do in the margin of our Bibles. But they that can conſult <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> upon LXXXI. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. will find good reaſon to take it quite otherwiſe; for the <hi>Full Moon:</hi> which giving light then all the night, made it a fit time for a journey, either in Winter (as by the darkneſs of the night, <hi>v.</hi> 9. I ſuppoſe it might now be) when the days are ſhort; or in Summer when the heat made them unfit for travel.</p>

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>In this Chapter the Wiſe man ſeems to me to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate more fully, what he had delivered in the concluſion of the foregoing (<hi>v.</hi> 32, 34, 35.) concerning the ſatisfaction and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they might expect to find, who would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the gates, and ſubmit themſelves to the government of that heavenly Wiſedom; which he had deſcribed to be acquainted with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99434:78"/> all the ſecrets of the Almighty. And which he here again repreſents as a glorious Queen, the daughter of heaven, adorued with all perfections (and [a] therefore uſes a word of the plural number (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) whereby to expreſs her excellencies) living in a ſtately Palace; unto which ſhe invites all miſguided Souls, and promiſes them, if they will forſake their follies, the moſt delicious entertainment.</p>
                  <p>[b] Which is ſet forth under the notion of a Feaſt, whereby the holy Writers are wont to expreſs (as the apteſt reſemblance of it that can be found) the high ſatisfaction, joy and pleaſure, which the principles of Wiſedom and Vertue fill our hearts withall; when we have ſuch a true reliſh of them, that we embrace them and digeſt them, and are inlivened by them to a pious life.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſubſtance of the Parable; every part of which is not to be minutely ſcand: nor ſhall I go about to ſay what is particularly meant [c] by the <hi>ſeven pillars</hi> of Wiſedom's houſe (though taking her houſe for the World, the <hi>ſeven pillars</hi> may well be thought the <hi>ſeven planets</hi>) what by her <hi>meat,</hi> what by her
<hi>drink,</hi> &amp;c. but look upon them onely as a deſcription of the ability of Wiſedom to impart compleat ſatisfaction unto thoſe that entertain her precepts. Which were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally taught in the <hi>Schools of the Prophets;</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to inſtruct the people (as the
<hi>Scribes</hi> did afterward) in the Law
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99434:78"/> of God: and being diſperſed in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Country, I have conjectured their <hi>Schools</hi> might be the <hi>Houſe</hi> here ſpoken of, where <hi>Wiſedom</hi> had her habitation. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay certainly how many of them there were, much leſs that there were juſt <hi>ſeven</hi> principal Schools, which might be lookt upon as the main ſupporters of Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: but there were more than one it is evident from the ſacred Hiſtory, where in one City, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> IX. 13, 14. we find <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſeated (in whoſe times theſe <hi>Schools</hi> began to flouriſh) who no doubt had there a
<hi>College of Prophets</hi> with him, as he had afterward, we find at
<hi>Ramah</hi> XIX. 20. and in another place called the <hi>Hill of God,</hi> where the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> had a Garriſon, we meet with another company of Prophets, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> X. 5, 10. And in after times there were <hi>Sons of the Prophets</hi> both at <hi>Bethel</hi> (where they ſeem to have been more anciently, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> X. 3.) and at <hi>Jericho,</hi> 2
<hi>King.</hi> II. 3. 5. and at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> IV. 38.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Schools</hi> alſo were ſeated in <hi>high places</hi> it appears from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> IX. 2. X. 5, 10. [d] 2
<hi>King.</hi> I. 9. (and might be one reaſon of their ſacrificing in ſuch places) which agrees exactly with what is ſaid here of Wiſedom's crying upon the <hi>higheſt places of the city,</hi> v. 3. to call all thoſe who had an appetite, to come and partake of her Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which there was ſome hope all thoſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99434:79"/> might do, who were merely inconſiderate and deluded (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) though <hi>ſcorners</hi> (as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
<hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. who perhaps called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Mad men) are ſo incapable of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that nothing will move them to become better; and therefore ſhe paſſes them by, and leaves them to their beaſtly folly: which inclines them rather to liſſen to the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuch filthy Strumpets as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Chap.</hi> VII.</p>
                  <p>Againſt whom there cannot be too much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Strumpets houſe being, as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> (Hom. 2. upon S.
<hi>Matth.</hi>) calls it, <hi>the very ſhop of the Devil:</hi> and therefore the Wiſe man again gives her Character in this Chapter, (<hi>v.</hi> 13, 14,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and repreſents the danger of being drawn in by her; that, if it was poſſible, he might make men ſenſible, there is nothing more inconſiſtent with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than to give up themſelves to thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure luſts, which have been the ruin of all thoſe that have been led by them.</p>
                  <p>That is one of the profitable leſſons to be learnt from this Chapter: in which the Wiſe man concludes his <hi>Preface</hi> to the Book of <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And therefore again repeats once more (<hi>v.</hi>
10.) that <hi>firſt Principle</hi> upon which all Religion is built, wherewith he began this preface (I. 7.) <hi>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wiſedom.</hi> Which they that want, will be apt to make a laughter of all good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and it is well if they be not angry at
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99434:79"/> thoſe, who are ſo kind as to reprove them. If they be, it is beſt to let them alone, and not caſt pearls before ſwine; as our Saviour teaches, [e] agreeable to the Doctrine of the Wiſe man, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Where the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (L. VIII. Advanc. of Learning, C. 2. Parab. 9.) is very curious and diſtinguiſhes between a
<hi>ſcorner</hi> and a <hi>wicked man</hi> (mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 7.) and between <hi>ſhame</hi> or reproach, and a <hi>blot;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently between <hi>reproof</hi> given to the one and <hi>rebuke</hi> to the other.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"For a <hi>ſcorner,</hi> ſaith he, onely makes us loſe our labour; but the other repays us with a ſtain and diſhonour. When a man inſtructs a ſcorner his time indeed which he thus imploys is thrown away, and others deride his pains, as a labour ill placed; and the ſcorner himſelf alſo deſpiſeth the knowledge which he is taught. <hi>Thus a man is put to ſhame.</hi> But the matter is tranſacted with greater danger in the reprehenſion of the other, becauſe
<hi>a wicked nature,</hi> not onely gives no ear to advice, but turns head againſt his <hi>Reprehender,</hi> now made odious to him: whom he either wounds preſently with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies before his face, or traduces after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to others behind his back."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I have not been thus nice in my <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> becauſe it is the manner, I obſerve, of the Wiſe man to repeat the ſame thing, in the ſame Verſe, in other words, throughout all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99434:80"/> this Book: and a <hi>ſcorner</hi> ſignifies the worſt of men.</p>
                  <p>[f] In the <hi>ninth</hi> Verſe alſo the ſame great perſon, following the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and reading the words thus, <hi>give occaſion to a wiſe man, and his wiſedom will be increaſed,</hi> makes this witty obſervation (in the ſame Chap. Parab. XXXII.) that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>occaſion</hi> when it is offered, ſhews <hi>the difference between Wiſedom that is ripened into habit, and that which ſwims onely in the brain and conceit, or is boaſted in ſpeech, but hath not taken deep root.</hi> For the former up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>occaſion</hi> preſented, whereby it may be exerciſed, is inſtantly quickned, addreſſes it ſelf to the buſineſs, and is ſo inlarged and dilated, that it ſeems greater than it ſelf: But the other which, before occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was brisk and buſie, now occaſion is given becomes amazed and confuſed; So that even he who preſumed himſelf poſſeſſed of it, begins to be in doubt, whether his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceptions of <hi>ſuch wiſedom,</hi> were not mere dreams, and empty ſpeculations."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there being no ſuch word as <hi>occaſion</hi> in the Original, and the word <hi>give</hi> ſeeming to me rather to refer to what the Wiſe man is ſpeaking of, viz. <hi>reproof</hi> or
<hi>inſtruction,</hi> I have waved this obſervation: which will do well alone, but not be connected with the Diſcourſe; which is my deſign to repreſent. And here note this as a mark of a hopefull
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99434:80"/> perſon, that is likely to become wiſe, if he be not galled with reproof; at which fools are wont to kick. This is a Truth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered moſt ſeriouſly, by which every man may take a meaſure of himſelf, whether he be likely to come to good or no.
<hi>If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be told of his faults, it is a ſhrewd ſign he is in the way to be undone; and hath not as yet ſo much as approached to the gates of Wiſedom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which admoniſhes us here of another great fault of mankind,
[g] <hi>who are moſt eager after that, which is prohibited to them.</hi> An obſervation which is as true of their fondneſs and readineſs to embrace heretical Doctrines (to which the <hi>Fathers</hi> apply <hi>v.</hi> 17.) if they be preached in a corner, and made a great ſecret; as of their appetite after thoſe pleaſures, from which they are reſtrained, and cannot have with publick approbation.</p>

                  <p>Here now properly begins the <hi>Book</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs (as the Title of this Chapter tells us) what hath been delivered hitherto, being rather a <hi>Preface;</hi> to awaken attention; and from ſundry arguments to commend the wiſe Inſtructions, which now follow, to every ones practice; and to caution thoſe, who would receive benefit by theſe Inſtructions, from ſuch things as may hinder their edification in the School of Wiſedom.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe Leſſons, in this <hi>firſt part</hi> of the Book, (which reaches to the 17th Verſe of the XXII. Chapter) are delivered in ſhort Sentences; every Verſe being a Leſſon by it ſelf, which commonly hath no connection with that which goes before and follows after: or if there be any, it is not ſo clear as to be eaſily made out. And theſe Leſſons are for the moſt part delivered, either by way of
<hi>Antitheſis,</hi> i. e. comparing oppoſites one with another; the wiſe, for inſtance, and the fooliſh, the diligent and the ſluggiſh, the rich and the poor, and, in general vertue and vice, aſſigning to each their proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99434:85"/> and puniſhments: or they are mere
<hi>Parables,</hi> that is, ſimilitudes; in which one thing is compared to another that reſembles it.</p>
                  <p>And he intending to inſtruct all ſorts of men in their ſeveral kinds of life, theſe Leſſons are very various; and do not merely inform them about their <hi>manners,</hi> but about the <hi>events</hi> alſo, which are wont (either frequently or ſometimes) to accompany or follow ſuch and ſuch eſtates, offices, and actions of humane life. And ſome are directions for ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; others for the ordering of houſhold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and others for the government of kingdoms. In ſhort, ſome are divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; others civil Advertiſements for the management of our ſelves in ſeveral paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of humane life: to the obſervance of which he excites the Reader ſometimes by promiſes, ſometimes by threatnings.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be expected that in a Paraphraſe, I ſhould preſerve the ſmartneſs that is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Sentences: And it will be hard to abridge, as I have done hitherto, the Contents of each Chapter. Yet, I ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething in it: And though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay there is an order obſerved in them all (they being onely a Collection of wiſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Aphoriſms, in which, Method is wont to be neglected by other Authours) yet the <hi>firſt</hi> Sentence of this Chapter, ſeems not to have been caſually, [a] but deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99434:86"/> ſet in the front of the reſt. Becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes ſo much every way to the happineſs of mankind, as a Religious care about the Education of Children. Which Parents are here admoniſhed to attend, if they deſire their Children ſhould not prove a grief and ſhame to them: and Children are put in mind of the Obedience they owe to their Inſtructions, that they may be a joy to their Parents.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (in his <hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi> L. VIII. C. 2. Parab. VII.) thinks that the <hi>gladneſs</hi> and heavineſs, which are in <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their Children prove good or bad, are here ſo accurately diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that he would repreſent a wiſe and well govern'd Son, to be chiefly <hi>a comfort to the Father,</hi> who knows the value of wiſedom and vertue better than the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (which account the <hi>Hebrews</hi> alſo give of this matter) and therefore rejoices more at the towardlineſs of his Son: which he not onely better underſtands, but hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken perhaps ſo much more care about his Education, that the good fruits of it give <hi>him</hi> a greater joy than they can do to the
<hi>Mother.</hi> Who on the other ſide is <hi>more grieved and diſcomforted</hi> at the calamity of a Son; both becauſe the affection of a Mother is more ſoft and tender, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance is conſcious to her ſelf that by too
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99434:86"/> much indulgence ſhe hath tainted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his tender years."</q> She is more at home alſo (it may be added) and therefore, having her Son's folly more in her eye, hath a greater ſhare in the grief that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>But this is not to be too much preſſed, I think, for both of them have ſuch a ſhare either in the <hi>joy</hi> or in the
<hi>ſorrow,</hi> that it is as hard to diſtinguiſh between them conſtantly, as it is to make a difference between the joy and grief for the well or ill doing of a <hi>Son,</hi> and the well or ill doing of a
<hi>Daughter:</hi> which may be, and oft times are, equal. And therefore I have but juſt touched upon this in my Paraphraſe of the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I ſhall note this further, that whether theſe Inſtructions were written with a peculiar reſpect to the education of
<hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s own Son, or indifferently for all, it was moſt judiciouſly done to begin with ſuch as this firſt part chiefly conſiſts of: there being ſo great a neceſſity (as the forenamed Writer obſerves in his VIIth Book Chap. 3.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that men drink deeply all
<hi>pious</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> knowledge before they taſte of
<hi>politick,</hi> that <hi>they who are bred up in the Courts of Princes, and in affairs of State from tender years, rarely attain to inward and ſincere probity of manners. For not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſoned with Religion and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of manners and offices of life, their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99434:87"/> judgments are corrupted and made to think, that there are no true and ſolid moral differences of things, but all things are to be meaſured by utility and ſucceſs.</hi>"</q> And in this falſe opinion they are the more immovably ſettled if to ill education, there be added the fewel of bad Books: which all thoſe will reject with diſdain, who ſhall be ſo happy as to make this Book their early ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>In which there follow here immediately (and very properly) ſome Inſtructions about get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting riches, and about the keeping and uſing them aright (<hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that a curſe may not be intailed upon them, and deſcend with them unto our children. And then
<hi>v.</hi> 7. a memorable obſervation is annexed, [b] (which <hi>Plato,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> obſerves, tranſlated into his VIIth Book of
<hi>Laws</hi>) concerning the fame of good and bad men, after they are dead. About which the ſame great man before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>) hath this Note in the ſame VIIIth Book, Parab. 8. That <hi>the Name of good men after Envy is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht (which cropt the bloſſome of their Fame, while they were alive) preſently ſhoots up and flouriſheth; and their Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes daily increaſe in ſtrength and vigour:</hi> But for wicked men
<hi>(though their fame through the partial favour of Friends, and of men of their own faction, may laſt for a little time) a deteſtation of their name ſprings
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99434:87"/> up not long after; and at laſt thoſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing praiſes end in infamy, and like bodies that putrifie, expire in a filthy and noiſome odour.</hi> And thus the LXX. in this place inſtead of the <hi>memory of the juſt is bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>is with bleſſing</hi> or <hi>benediction,</hi> have theſe words, <hi>the memory of the juſt is with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums or praiſes:</hi> which is the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the phraſe. And accordingly the Church commemorates the Saints of God, recounting their worthy deeds, and praiſing Him for them. Of which ſee Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> Diſcourſe XXII.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the Chapter conſiſts of mixt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, concerning the difference between <hi>wiſe</hi> men and
<hi>fools, idle perſons</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ill-natured</hi> people and thoſe who are candid and kind (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) and eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the vices and vertues of the tongue, and their rewards and puniſhments,
<hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And one remarkable obſervation is inſerted, <hi>v.</hi> 22. which belongs to [c] that head of diligence and laboriouſneſs: upon which, he remembers us, no man is ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, as to imagin to obtain what he would have by that alone; but to look up to God as the donour of all good things, and giving ſucceſs to our induſtry. Which was a thing little thought of by heathens, who were too prone to imagin all things requiſite unto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to be placed in themſelves. But the Scriptures every where inculcate this, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99434:88"/> it is God who gives wiſedom to the wiſe, and victory to the valiant, and riches to the diligent, and good ſucceſs to the prudent and potent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>[d] <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which add that obſervation alſo, <hi>v.</hi>
24. which may be further improved than is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Paraphraſe, to this ſenſe; <hi>that wicked men many times draw upon themſelves that which they feared, by thoſe very means whereby they ſtudy to avoid them.</hi> An Example of which (as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves in his
<hi>Phaleg,</hi> L. I. c. 16. Part. 1.) we have in thoſe that built the Tower of <hi>Babel:</hi> who for fear of diſperſion deſigned to build a City and a Tower, ſaying, <hi>Go to, let us build,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>leſt we be ſcattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth,</hi> XI. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. But God ſo ordered it that this very attempt was the occaſion of their diſperſion, and brought what they feared ſooner upon them, <hi>atque ipſum mali remedium, illis ceſſit in periculum:</hi> the very remedy of the evil they would have avoided, leading them directly into it.</p>
                  <p>R. <hi>Levi</hi> hath an obſervation that the precepts of Wiſedom from the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 10th verſe of the XVIIIth are in a manner all concerning the danger of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of vice and wickedneſs: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they are all concerning other ſubjects.

                  <p>This Chapter conſiſts of many promiſcuous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, concerning ſuch things as will make men happy or miſerable. It begins with an Admonition concerning <hi>Juſtice</hi> in our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings one with another: without which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (which God deſigns and takes a ſpecial care to uphold) cannot be preſerved. And mankind being very apt to be regardleſs what they doe, towards God or towards man, when they grow rich and great; he next gives a caution againſt <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>Inſolence,</hi> as a certain forerunner of ruin. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in forgetfulneſs of God, confidence in mens ſelves, deſpiſing others, ſlighting good counſels, and attempting things out of the bounds of mens place and calling (all which proceed from ſtupid folly) naturally leads men headlong into deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Then he commends <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.) and repreſents the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Vertue and Wickedneſs, in order to mens private ſafety (<hi>v.</hi> 5, 6,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and to the publick ſecurity (<hi>v.</hi> 10, 11.) After which follow a great many prudent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and advices, for mens private, and for the common good: with ſuch remarks upon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99434:94"/> ſundry vertues and vices, as are ſufficient to invite to the one, and deter from the other.</p>
                  <p>[a] Among the reſt there is one, <hi>v.</hi> 21. (tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thus by us, <hi>though hand join in hand, the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed</hi>) upon which there are as many gloſſes almoſt, as there are Interpreters. But I have onely put together thoſe two ſenſes of the <hi>former</hi> part of the verſe, which are moſt agreeable to the
<hi>latter;</hi> and do not think fit to trouble the Reader with the other, any further than merely to inform him of this one thing. That moſt Interpreters by <hi>hand in hand</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the hands of divers perſons: but ſome few take it, for the hands of one and the ſame perſon, who puts one hand into the other. And theſe laſt named, make the ſenſe one of theſe two ways: either that though a ſinner indeavour to hide his ſin (as a man doth a thing which he holds in one hand and covers with the other) he ſhall notwithſtanding be found out and ſuffer for it; or that, though wicked men doe nothing, but like an idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have their hands folded one in the other, yet they are not free from ſin; which they are deviſing in their mind, and will draw a juſt vengeance upon them.</p>
                  <p>[b] In the next verſe I have followed <hi>Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (<hi>de Animal. S.</hi> Part I. L. II. C. 57.) in his tranſlation of thoſe two words <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> which he renders
<hi>her mind departeth, viz.</hi> from the love of her husband: but I
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99434:95"/> have not neglected the other ſenſe of which I think thoſe words are capable.</p>
                  <p>[c] In the 29th verſe I have adhered to the opinion of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (Book VIII. of the <hi>Advanc. of Learning,</hi> Ch. 2. Parab. 9.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"who takes it for a profitable admonition touching diſcords in families and domeſtick breaches (but may as well be applied to whole kingdoms, which are larger families) which whoſoever cheriſhes among his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or ſervants (or people) as a means to have his affairs better adminiſtred, when they have an evil eye upon, and hate one another; commonly finds his hopes turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wind.

<hi>two</hi> things. <hi>Firſt</hi> that the Church is ſubject to the Croſs, which the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of Tyrants may lay upon it: but

                  <p>This Chapter begins with an Admonition, often inculcated in this Book, concerning the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith a man, that would be wiſe and good, ought to receive charitable reproofs. And there are ſeveral things alſo repeated, concerning the Providence of Almighty God; in puniſhing men according to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and delivering good men from thoſe who ſeek their deſtruction: which is notably expreſſed in <hi>three</hi> verſes one after another, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. where he obſerves how the wicked labouring to compaſs their ends, by coſenage, or by violence, even by bloud (eſpecially if they can privately make a man away) not onely miſcarry in their deſigns, but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly overturned, and ſubverted out of their places, wherein they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch injuſtice and cruelty.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Inſtructions alſo here repeated about ſeveral vertues and vices; eſpecially, thoſe of the tongue. Among which
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> commends this to the remembrance of the Reader,
<hi>v.</hi> 22, [a] <hi>lying lips are an abomination to the Lord;</hi> who recommends
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99434:102"/> to us, ſays he, the <hi>love and care of Truth;</hi> both in doctrines concerning Himſelf, and in Arts, and in all honeſt Covenants, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. For Truth being among the chiefeſt and moſt conſpicuous vertues, therefore the contrary vice is condemned, by a terrible word, and called <hi>Abomination,</hi> i. e. ſuch an evil as God deteſts with a ſingular indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for Idols are called
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or <hi>abominable things</hi>) which is principally true of ſuch lies, as are on purpoſe invented to deſtroy mens fame; and much more of ſuch as are deviſed for the taking away their lives and the ruin of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: ſuch as thoſe which <hi>David</hi> often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains were contrived againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made notable remarks alſo upon another paſſage in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 10. where he obſerves concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer [b] part of the verſe,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that there is implanted in man's nature a noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent affection of pity and compaſſion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here <hi>Mercy:</hi> which extends it ſelf even unto brute creatures, that are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordination ſubject to his command. And therefore this compaſſion hath ſome analogy with that of a Prince towards his ſubjects. Nay further, it is moſt certain, that the worthier any ſoul is, the larger is its compaſſion. For contracted and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate minds, imagin theſe things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not to them: but the mind that looks
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99434:103"/> upon it ſelf as a nobler portion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, is kndly affected towards inferiour creatures, out of the communion there is between them: wherefore we ſee that there were under the old Law many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts concerning this, which were not ſo much merely
<hi>ceremonial,</hi> as <hi>inſtitutions of Mercy.</hi>"</q>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As that of not eating fleſh with the bloud in it, and ſuch like."</q> I ſuppoſe he means thoſe mentioned, XXIII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 19. V. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. XXII. 6, 7. XXV.
4.

                  </p>
                  <p>I omit what the ſame Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> there ſays (Book VIII. of the <hi>Advanc. of Learn.</hi> C. 2. Parab. 14.) concerning the ancient <hi>Eſſens,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and concerning ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and the preſent <hi>Turks</hi> (who are full of affection to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99434:103"/> brute creatures;) and onely obſerve that he looks upon the latter part of the ſame verſe, as a kind of caution added by the wiſe man; leſt we ſhould think he patronizes all ſort of mercy and compaſſion.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, the mercy which ſpares wicked perſons from being cut off by the hand of juſtice, is not mercy, but more cruel than cruelty it ſelf. For cruelty is exerciſed upon ſingle perſons one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but this kind of mercy, by the grant of impunity, arms the whole band of impious men againſt the innocent."</q> So by the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the wicked,</hi> he underſtands, <hi>mercy ſhewn to the wicked:</hi> Which is an unuſual form of ſpeech, and diſagreeing to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which the wiſe man, in this prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial ſaying, makes between the righteous and the wicked. And therefore it is not to be embraced, nor to be lookt upon as a true expoſition: in which though I believe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Druſius,</hi> yet he hath very little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany beſides. And the ſenſe rather lies as I have expreſſed it in the Paraphraſe: in which if I have added more than Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do, I am confident it will appear to him, that conſiders, not to be without reaſon. For theſe words, <hi>the tender mercies of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are cruel,</hi> ſeem to me to have the ſame ſenſe with that proverbial ſpeech among the Greeks,

                  <p>In the twelfth verſe I have expreſſed both ſenſes of which the word <hi>mezod</hi> is capable:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99434:104"/> which ſignifies both a <hi>net</hi> and a <hi>fortreſs.</hi> And ſo I have done in the next (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) which may be rendred two ways. Either, that <hi>by prevaricating with his lips, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man lays ſnares,</hi> or [c] that <hi>he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſnared by his prevarications.</hi> In the ſame manner I have comprehended more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than one, in ſeveral other verſes; which if I ſhould particularly mention, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large this Preface beyond its juſt length. Elſe I ſhould have made ſome remarks upon <hi>v.</hi> 15. where the danger of ſelf-love and ſelf-conceit is repreſented: which hath ever this effect, that it makes men ſlight, if not reject good counſel; out of a vain opinion, that none can adviſe them better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: which is to follow the direction of a fool.

Which is a wiſe ſaying, but not agreeable to the Hebrew Text.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely add that as the Chapter begins with an Admonition to hearken to reproof (eſpecially from Parents) which is repeated again in the middle, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 18. ſo it concludes, [e] in the laſt verſe but one, with an advice to Parents; not to ſpare the rod, if reproof will not do: which is but neceſſary in very young Children; becauſe there is no other means perhaps to make them underſtand the difference between good and evil, decent and unſeemly; but onely to make them ſmart for the one, and to give them ſome ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the other. Some Children, that is, are ſo diſpoſed, that they muſt be thus trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and it ſeems a wonderfull piece of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the old <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> (as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in his <hi>Laconical Inſtitutes</hi>) that, out
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99434:111"/> of an univerſe love and care for each others good, made it lawfull for any man to correct the Child of another perſon, if he ſaw him doe amiſs. And if the Child complained of it to his Father; it was lookt upon as a fault in the Father, if he did not correct him again for making that complaint. Such was their confidence in each other, that every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much concerned for another man's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as for his own, would never doe them any injury, nor unreaſonably check them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe. For this is the Character <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives of them; that they did not as in other Cities, <hi>look every man onely after his own children, ſervants and cattel; but every man lookt upon what was his neighbour's, as his own,</hi>

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>[a] As the foregoing Chapter began with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a towardly child, ſo this with the Character of a good Mother of a family: who by her prudent care makes it flouriſh; when a lewd woman throws the houſe (as we ſay) out of the windows: For ſo the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>She pulls down the houſe with her own hands,</hi> that is, ruins the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily without any other help. <hi>There needs no more than a bad wife, to undo a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[b] A little after this (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) there follows an Admonition for the man without doors, as here for the woman within; that he do not neglect his husbandry. Of which <hi>Oxen,</hi> every one knows, were the principal inſtruments: being not onely employed in that Country (as they are here) in plowing the ground, and carrying home the crop; but alſo in treading out the corn. The ſtrength alſo of the Ox (which is here mentioned) is celebrated in all Authours: and thence <hi>Bulls</hi> are called
<hi>Abbarim,</hi> i. e. <hi>robuſt</hi> among the Hebrews; who were very carefull about the breeding of theſe moſt profitable creatures. It is not my buſineſs to inquire after the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99434:116"/> 
                     <hi>Alaphim</hi> and <hi>Sor</hi> (which we render here, in this Verſe, by the ſame Engliſh word) but certain it is, they are uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly for either ſex; and the latter without any reſpect to age: though moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it ſignifies one grown to maturity, which we call an <hi>Ox.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the next Verſe but one (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) the Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> (in his VII Book of the <hi>Adv. of Learning,</hi> Chap. 2.) hath made this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gloſs, <hi>He that comes to ſeek after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with a mind to ſcorn and cenſure, ſhall be ſure to find matter enough for his humour, but none for his inſtruction.</hi> One reaſon of which is, that this humour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding all things, ſprings from a great pride and conceit of their own wit, which diſpoſes them to ſeek for Wiſedom not from others, but wholly from themſelves: and ſo (as the Wiſe man obſerves) they are not likely to find it, where it is not to be had. When he that attributes leſs to himſelf, and hath the humility to liſten to inſtruction, in a ſhort time attains great wiſedom. I cannot wholly omit the opinion of <hi>Janſenius;</hi> who thinks the Wiſe man means that he hath accuſtomed himſelf to laugh at all wholeſome counſel, and in ſome ſtrait or other begins to think what is beſt to doe, commonly finds himſelf at ſuch a loſs, that he cannot ſee his way out of it. And it may be applied to thoſe alſo, <hi>who having mockt at Religion all their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99434:116"/> days, at laſt deſire to underſtand it; but cannot, through their own inveterate indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[d] In the next Verſe I have joyned thoſe two ſenſes together, which it may have according to the different acception of the word
<hi>Minne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> ſignifying either <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] The next (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) I take to be that, which the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> minding the ſenſe rather than the words, thus tranſlates (<hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learn.</hi> B. VIII. C. 2. Parab. 30.)
<hi>Prudens advertit ad greſſus ſuos, ſtultus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit ad dolos.</hi> Which his Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour (who refers this to XXVII. <hi>Prov.</hi>
12. which is quite to another purpoſe) reades thus, <hi>A wiſe man is wary of his way, a cunning fool ſeeks evaſions.</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which that Lord thus deſcants:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"There be two ſorts of Wiſedom, the one <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſound,</hi> the other <hi>counterfeit</hi> and
<hi>falſe:</hi> which laſt <hi>Solomon</hi> doubts not to call folly. He that applies himſelf to the former, takes heed to his own ways and footings, foreſeeing dangers, ſtudying remedies, uſing the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of good men, and fortifying himſelf againſt the wicked: wary how he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a buſineſs; and not unprepared for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and how he may come off handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: attent upon advantages, courageous againſt impediments, with innumerable other things, that relate to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99434:117"/> of his own ways and actions. But that other kind of Wiſedom is made up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of fallacies, and cunning devices; and relies wholly upon hopes of circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and framing them as he liſt himſelf. This Wiſedom the Parable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not onely as wicked, but as fooliſh. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> it is not in the number of things, which are in our own power, nor is it directed by any conſtant rule; but new ſtratagems muſt be every day deviſed, the old failing and growing uſeleſs. And, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> as ſoon as ever a man hath got the name, and the opinion of a cunning crafty companion, he hath deprived himſelf utterly of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtrument for the management of his affairs, which is <hi>Truſt:</hi> And ſo he will find by experience all things to go croſs to his deſires. For, <hi>laſtly,</hi> theſe arts and ſhifts, how ever they promiſe fair, and much pleaſe ſuch as practiſe them, yet they are commonly fruſtrated, and which is worſe end ſadly."</q> Which
<hi>Tacitus</hi> hath well obſerved in theſe remarkable words,
<hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia calida &amp; audacia, expectatione laeta, tractatu dura, eventu triſtia,</hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Crafty and audacious counſels, are joyfull in the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, difficult in the management, and ſad in the event."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[f] There is the ſame difficulty in the 9<hi>th</hi> verſe that was in the <hi>ſeventh:</hi> For the word <hi>Jaliz</hi> is tranſlated by ſome <hi>mock,</hi> by others <hi>excuſe:</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:99434:117"/> and ſo (beſides what I have comprehended in my Paraphraſe) there may be this ſenſe of the words;
<hi>Fools indeavour to make hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome apologies for their faults, and to find out colourable excuſes; but upright men freely confeſs them, and eaſily grant a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for them, and make up the differences which they raiſe in a friendly manner.</hi> Or if we retain the acception of <hi>mocking,</hi> this may be the ſenſe of the verſe; <hi>Fools laugh and jeer at thoſe who have committed a ſin: but good men pity them, and by kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs ſeek their amendment.</hi> I know not how otherways to make out the oppoſition, which is uſual between one part of the Verſe and the other, unleſs we chuſe to take it thus; That <hi>when fools offend God in the higheſt manner, they make nothing of it: but if good men in the leaſt offend, they preſently beg his pardon and ſeek his grace and favour.</hi> The former part of the ſentence alſo may be inverted, and make this plain obvious ſenſe; which is as natural as any: <hi>Sin will expoſe thoſe to ſcorn, who are ſo fooliſh as to commit it:</hi> And then the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part is as plain; <hi>But the upright will have favour both with God and man.</hi> A good Admonition to them that make a mock of ſin; which will in time make a mock of them, and expoſe them as ridiculous fools.</p>
                  <p>[g] Some take the next (<hi>verſe</hi> 10.) to be an Admonition to a prudent man, that he ſhould
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99434:118"/> conceal both his grief and his joy; and keep them to himſelf. But it is rather an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to every one, not to cenſure too heavily the paſſions of grief or of ioy in others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cauſes of them may be unknown to us. Or we may look upon the former part of the Verſe, as an admonition to thoſe that are at eaſe; <hi>not to cenſure too ſeverely the complaints of thoſe that are in pain or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> and the latter part as an admonition to ſuch as are delivered from trouble, <hi>to be more thankfull than any one can exhort them to be, becauſe they beſt know what reaſon they have for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[h] The next Verſe but one (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) is the onely ſentence which <hi>Melancthon</hi> points out to his Scholars, as moſt remarkable in this Chapter. Which he takes to be an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the weakneſs and blindneſs of mens judgment, and all humane counſels: which miſtake lamentably, and lead men frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into ruine. According to that ſaying of <hi>Simonides</hi>

                     <hi>ſhadows too oft cheat us of the reality</hi> Againſt which there is no remedy, but the word of God, and invoking his direction: according to ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe, <hi>Thy word is a light to my feet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99434:118"/> and truſt in him, and he will bring it to paſs. This ſhall be your wiſedom, to walk in my precepts,</hi> Deut. IV.</p>
                  <p>[i] And as ſome are deceived by their own counſels, ſo others by the counſel of flatterers; if they be ſo ſimple as to believe every one that pretends to kindneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 15. Where
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> notes very appoſitely, that <hi>as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without ſimplicity degenerates into craft: ſo ſimplicity without prudence, is no better than mere fatuity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[k] In like manner the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>v.</hi> 23. that talking without doing is vain; and to no purpoſe; but onely to be a cover perhaps for Idleneſs. As the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (<hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning,</hi> B. VIII. C. 11. Paral. 28.) gloſſes upon that Verſe in theſe words:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Solomon</hi> here ſeparates the fruit of the <hi>labour of the tongue,</hi> and of the <hi>labour of the hands,</hi> as if want was the revenue of the one, and wealth the revenue of the other. For it commonly comes to paſs, that they who talk liberally, boaſt much, and promiſe mighty matters, are beggars; and receive no benefit by their brags or by any thing they diſcourſe of. Nay, rather for the moſt part ſuch men are not induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent in their employment; but onely feed and fill themſelves with words, as with wind. Certainly as the Poet ſays, <hi>Qui ſilet, eſt firmus,</hi> He that is conſcious to himſelf of proficiency in his endeavours,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99434:119"/> contents himſelf with inward applauſe in his own breaſt, and holds his peace: but he who knows within himſelf that he onely hunts after vain glory, and hath nothing elſe to live upon, talks abundantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports wonders unto others."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral other remarkable things in the reſt of the Chapter; but this Preface is already ſo long, that I ſhall onely touch upon one, <hi>verſe</hi> 34.</p>

For it is not ſafe to bear your ſelf otherways, unleſs you have to deal with very generous and noble diſpoſitions, which are rare. But then, this Anſwer (which is the ſecond and principal thing here adviſed) muſt be very ſoft and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, not harſh and peremptory: for that will make the buſineſs worſe than if it had never been meddled with at all; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that wrath which you ſhould ſtudy to appeaſe."</q>

                     <hi>Melancthon</hi> alſo, I find, in his ſhort Lectures upon this Book, commends this Leſſon very much to his Scholars: but looks upon it as a general precept for the preſervation of peace, and avoiding unneceſſary contentions; which ariſe out of pride, ambition, moroſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, emulation, wrath, ſuperſtition; which move men either to give ill words, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn worſe to thoſe that are given them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overcome by ſharpneſs and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, not by lenity and moderation.

                     <hi>anſwer,</hi> ſignifies as well what is firſt ſaid, as the reply to it.

Moral good works</hi> will pleaſe God, when done for this end; not that we may merit thereby remiſſion of ſin: but that we may be obedient to God, and teach others to know him, and to celebrate him. And then alſo <hi>ceremonies,</hi> inſtituted by God, are pleaſing to him, when they are done for this end; not to merit remiſſion: but becauſe they are ſigns admoniſhing us of the promiſes, to ſtirr up our faith; and likewiſe becauſe they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99434:127"/> are <hi>ſigna confeſſionis,</hi> ſigns of what Religion we profeſs; and <hi>laſtly, quia ſunt nervi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationis,</hi> becauſe they are the nerves whereby the Congregation of Chriſtian people are joyned together, and preſerved in unity. Theſe true ends, ſaith he, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Church, and impious opinions to be removed.

                  <p>That this was his opinion alſo, appears in his Commentaries upon the <hi>Fiftieth Pſalm:</hi> where he ſaith, that <hi>even humane Ceremonies are, in ſome ſort, the nerves of diſcipline;</hi> and condemns onely thoſe that make them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the remiſſion of ſin.

<hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And if any one ask, what muſt be done with Ceremonies inſtituted by man, he anſwers; <hi>ſome of them are neceſſary,</hi> and therefore muſt be retained; as certain days, in which the word of God is taught; and certain rites in the Church, ſuch as that of ſinging Pſalms; and certain forms of communicating,

                     <hi>It is impious alſo,</hi> he reſolves, <hi>to think that all Ceremonies were inſtituted by wicked Popes.</hi> No, there were ſome prudent and holy men, who perceived how ſupine and dull the minds of the vulgar were; that they would never be ſenſible of the dignity and amplitude of Religion, unleſs their minds were both awakned and deteined by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend ſolemn Ceremonies; which might help to lift them up, and teach them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are his Reaſons why all Ceremonies ought not to be aboliſhed; becauſe ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; others neceſſary; and others, that are not, have no impiety in them, and are very profitable for weaker minds. Which I thought good here to inſert; becauſe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

                  <p>I have been ſo long in this, that I muſt but briefly mention <hi>two</hi> verſes more: upon which the before named Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> hath given ſome touches.</p>
                  <p>[c] The firſt is <hi>v.</hi> 15. where by <hi>a merry heart</hi> he underſtands a good Conſcience (<hi>Adv. of Learn.</hi> B. VII. Ch. 1.) and thus gloſſes. <hi>A mind conſcious of good intentions, though ſucceſs be wanting, affords truer and purer joy, and to nature more agreeable, than all that this world can furniſh a man withall, either for the enjoyment of his deſires, or the repoſe of his mind.</hi> The words indeed of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeem to be larger, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto all that are void of care, anxiety and ſorrow: but this is a pious ſenſe, and may well be comprehended in them.</p>
                  <p>[d] The other place is <hi>v.</hi> 19. the beginning of it: where he hath inlarged the ſenſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than I have done in my Paraphraſe (and the words will bear it) to this purpoſe, that <hi>ſloth, in the concluſion, proves labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"For diligence and ſedulous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration levels the way we are to go in any buſineſs; and removes impediments in our paſſage. But he that is ſlothfull, and put's off all to the laſt point of execution, muſt needs perpetually, at every ſtep, paſs as it were through briars and thorns; which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99434:129"/> ever and anon intangle, detain and hinder him in his proceedings. The ſame obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be made concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Family, wherein if there be due care and providence uſed, all goes on cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and as it were of its own accord, without noiſe or tumult: but if thoſe be wanting, when ſome greater occaſion falls out, all matters throng in to be diſpatched at once; the Servants are in an uproar, the whole houſe rings, and there is nothing well done in that confuſion."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] The two verſes before this ſome have connected; but there is no neceſſity of it: though it be a great truth, that
<hi>paſſionate men are apt to make diſturbance even at feaſts; which men of temperate ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to appeaſe, though affronts be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them.</hi> According to that excellent advice of <hi>Seneca, Let diſſention begin from others, but reconciliation from thee.</hi> It is there obſerved by
<hi>Bochartus</hi> (L. II. <hi>de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalibus Sacris,</hi> Cap. 32. Part 1.) that <hi>herbs,</hi> or as ſome tranſlate it, <hi>green pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> was the pooreſt; and an Ox put up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtall and there fatted (or as the
<hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts</hi> underſtand the phraſe <hi>a crammed Ox</hi>) the nobleſt entertainment in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. For it is reckoned among the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made for the tables of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and in the New Teſtament, the Marriage proviſion which the King made at

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>[a] This Chapter begins with a moſt neceſſary obſervation, which a good man ought alway to have in his mind (for which cauſe it is repeated, with little difference, twice more in this very Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 33. and again Chap. XIX. 21.) the ſenſe of which our Tranſlation ſeems to have miſſed. For it aſcribes both the
<hi>Preparation of the heart,</hi> and <hi>the Anſwer of the tongue,</hi> unto the Lord (which is true in this regard, that without Him we can doe nothing), whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words run plainly thus, <hi>Man hath the diſpoſing of the heart,</hi> he may, with God's leave and common aſſiſtance, intend, propound, reſolve within himſelf, what he will ſay and doe: but that he ſhall be able to utter things in that order he hath premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or, if he be able, ſhall attain the end of his deliberation, and eloquent ſpeech, is more than he can undertake; for
<hi>that is as the Lord pleaſeth.</hi> This ſeems to me to be better opened by <hi>Melancthon</hi> than any one I have read. Who truly obſerves, that ſuch ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe doe not take away the liberty of man's will or choice; but onely ſhew, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the beſt men ſometimes err in their choice;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99434:136"/> and that the ſucceſs doth not always anſwer. For we muſt diligently diſtinguiſh, ſays he, between our election and the ſucceſs: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we need a double help of God, for the making a happy choice. One of <hi>judging aright;</hi> and the other afterward, of <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing events.</hi> For unleſs our judgment be ruled right, many errors happen; as we ſee in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, Zedekiah, Demoſthenes, Pompey, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero;</hi> who all erred <hi>in eligendo bello</hi> in their reſolves about war; and direfull events fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And ſometime alſo when the mind doth not err in its judgment; yet God is not pleaſed to aſſiſt the action, for other cauſes. As in the War againſt the
<hi>Benjamites,</hi> which miſcarried a great while, becauſe the
<hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> truſted in their own ſtrength. We muſt always therefore be ſenſible, that happy events do not depend merely on humane forecaſt, diligence and Power; as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himſelf.</hi> i. e. he cannot have what ſucceſs he will; but muſt be beholden to God for his happineſs. This our weakneſs God would have us to acknowledge, and to fear and depend on Him; as it follows here, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Commit thy work unto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi> To this uſe we ought to accommodate ſuch ſayings, as theſe, not to a Stoical opinion of neceſſity. Thus he.</p>

                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:99434:136"/> [b] And he no leſs worthily gloſſes, upon the common Interpretation of <hi>v.</hi> 4. the latter part of which hath exerciſed many Pens to little purpoſe: when the ſenſe is clear, though no expoſitor, that I have ſeen, hath hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God makes ſome uſe of wicked men, as well as of all things elſe;</hi> which they ſhall ſerve whether they will or no. For He
<hi>diſpoſes</hi> (ſo the word we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>hath made</hi> is to be underſtood; not of his <hi>creating</hi> things) all things correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his own will and pleaſure, which they all obey. So
<hi>lammaanthu</hi> ſeems to be beſt tranſlated, not <hi>for himſelf,</hi> but <hi>according to his will.</hi> However, I have included the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation alſo in my Paraphraſe; but applied <hi>the day of evil</hi> not to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which He inflicts upon the wicked for their ſins; but which He orders them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon others, when their iniquities are ripe for his vengeance. For it is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of his Providence, to direct the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrath, hatred, revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he ſees in ſome wicked mens hearts, to vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there, where it will doe ſervice to Him. Who wiſely and juſtly makes ſome wicked men doe execution upon others like themſelves. This ſeems to me the moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and natural ſenſe of the words: which were remarkably fulfilled in the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers; whom our Saviour uſed to puniſh his crucifiers. Not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99434:137"/> that they undertook that War, out of any deſign or deſire to doe our bleſſed Saviour right; but out of an ambition to inſlave the World: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>yet God made uſe of them for another deſign, as publick executioners, by whom he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ungodly,</hi> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks upon LXXIV <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>[c] I muſt omit <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s gloſſes upon this Verſe, and the two next; that I may have room for his pertinent obſervation upon <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>A divine ſentence is in the lips of the King,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99434:137"/> to his Laws; but built upon them, either by demonſtrations, or probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it was a ſingular motion in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s reaſoning about the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Child. And in the judgment of
<hi>Gonzaga</hi> in the laſt age, upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Governour of
<hi>Milan</hi> under him. Who having held a Noble perſon Captive a long time, would not deliver him to his Wife (when ſhe petition'd and offered a large ſum of money for his redemption) unleſs he might lye with her: and after he had obtained his deſire, then cauſed her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to be killed, and delivered him dead to her. Which when <hi>Gonzaga</hi> heard, and had examined, he compelled him to marry this woman; and as ſoon as he had done that, he condemned him to be immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and gave her all his eſtate."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we are not from ſuch places as this to infer, that Kings cannot give a wrong judgment: though this be as good a concluſion as from thoſe words, <hi>the Prieſt's lips ſhall preſerve knowledge,</hi> to conclude the Pope cannot err. Kings from this place of <hi>Solomon</hi> may as well pretend to Infallibility, as Prieſts from that place of
<hi>Malachi.</hi> Nay, if we reſpect either the form of this precept, or the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99434:138"/> of God's promiſe for ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, we muſt confeſs, this place is more plain and peremptory for Kings; than any can be brought for the High-Prieſt's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, in giving definitive ſentence. And yet all the places (as a famous Divine of our own ſpeaks, Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> B. III. upon the Creed, <hi>Chap.</hi>
12.) that can be brought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the King's or the Prieſt's Authority, rather ſhew what manner of men they ſhould be, both in life and judgment; than aſſure them of any infallibility of judgment, if they be diſſolute in life, and regard not the Laws of God. This was a thing never dreamt of by any, till the notoriouſly infamous lives of Popes diſcredited the titles of Sanctity and Infallibility (which from the conceit of their predeceſſors integrity they had uſurped) and inforced their flatterers to frame a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sanctity in Doctrine, ſeparated from Sanctity of Life.</p>
                  <p>I thought it not amiſs to ſay thus much upon this ſubject, becauſe I find even <hi>Maldonate</hi> himſelf in his Notes upon this place, hath the confidence to conclude the Pope muſt needs have this privilege, which is promiſed to Kings: when, it is apparent, Kings are not infallible; and conſequently, by his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, Popes cannot be ſo.</p>
                  <p>There are other notable ſentences which would deſerve a larger gloſs than I have given in the Paraphraſe; which I muſt paſs by: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99434:138"/> this Preface is already prolonged to a great length.</p>
                  <p>[d] I ſhall onely therefore mention two. One <hi>v.</hi> 21. where <hi>Wiſedom</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> are compared together. The former of which, no doubt, is of greateſt value, as we ſee in thoſe words of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled himſelf for the ſervice impoſed upon him, for want of the other faculty; <hi>There is Aaron,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>he ſhall be thy ſpeaker, and thou ſhalt be to him as God.</hi> Yet in profit, and popular eſteem Wiſedom gives place to Eloquence; according to the vulgar Tranſlation of this verſe, <hi>Sapiens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de appellatur prudens, ſed dulcis Eloquia majora reperiet.</hi> Signifying, ſays the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (<hi>Adv. of Learning,</hi> Book VI. Ch. 3.) not obſcurely, that <hi>profoundneſs of wiſedom may help men to fame and admiration; but it is Eloquence which prevails in buſineſs and active life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] The other is <hi>v.</hi> 26. where I have put two ſenſes together; according to the different acceptions of the Hebrew word
<hi>Amal:</hi> which ſignifies either to take pains ones ſelf, or to moleſt others. But I can ſee no reaſon why <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſhould favour the LXX Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who, againſt the ſtream of all other Interpreters, apply theſe words to an ungodly man's <hi>digging up evil</hi> to himſelf, as if the meaning were, <hi>he digs a pit for himſelf, and the words he ſpeaks are the cauſe of his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99434:139"/> puniſhment, as if he were burnt:</hi> unleſs it proceeded from his fondneſs for the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> which he was deſirous to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every where. The very beſt of them, it appears by him (who was one of the moſt learned and judicious Interpreters in the Romiſh Church) are moſt devoutly bent to our deſtruction: For he cannot forbear here to alledge that Inquiſition as a proof of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s words, <hi>Id exemplo Inquiſitionis Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panicae perſpicuum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the example of the Spaniſh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; whereby he that ſpeaks any thing raſhly againſt the faith, is deſervedly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the fire; which I WISH WERE DONE EVERY WHERE.</hi> Thus in the moſt literal ſenſe, this Jeſuits lips are as a burning fire; in which he would have us not onely ſinged, but devoured: in purſuance of this Maxim of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Which others ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly interpret of thoſe calumnies, diſcords, ſeditions, which evil men raiſe, by their tongues, to the deſtruction of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

                  <p>In the firſt verſe of this Chapter the Wiſe man obſerves how happy that Family is, which lives in peace, and perfect agreement one with another; though they have but a mean eſtate. And next to this how happy a thing it is, if there be but one wiſe and vertuous man in a Family (ſuppoſe he be but a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) when any diſſentions and differences ariſe in it. For ſo the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (<hi>Advanc. of Learning,</hi> Book VIII. Chap. 2. Parab. 2.) expounds the [a] ſecond verſe: whoſe words I will ſet down, becauſe, if they hit not the ſenſe compleatly yet, they very pithily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a part of it, and carry in them a very important truth.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"In all troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Families, ſaith he, there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome <hi>Servant</hi> or <hi>gentle Friend,</hi> who being powerfull with both ſides, may mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and compoſe the differences that are among them. To whom, in that reſpect, the whole houſe, and the Maſter himſelf are much engaged and beholden. This Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, if he aim onely at his own ends, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and aggravates the diviſions of the Family: but if he be ſincerely faithfull and upright, certainly he deſerveth much;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99434:146"/> ſo as to be reckoned as one of the Brethren; or at leaſt to receive a fiduciary admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the inheritance."</q>

<q rend="inline margQuotes">"There are two ways of proceeding, to arbitrate differences and reconcile affections. The one begins with an act of oblivion of what is paſt; the other begins with a repetition of wrongs, ſubjoyning apologies and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now ſome think this laſt to be the onely way; inſomuch that I have heard a prudent perſon and great Stateſman lay down this Maxime, <hi>He that treats of peace, without a recapitulation of the terms of difference, rather deceives mens minds with the ſweet name of agreement, than compoſes them by equity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of right.</hi> But <hi>Solomon,</hi> a wiſer man than he, is of a contrary opinion: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving an act of oblivion, and forbidding repetition. For in repetition or renewing the memory of the cauſes of difference, there are theſe inconveniences: not onely that it is, as we ſay <hi>unguis in ulcere,</hi> raking in the ulcer, which very much exaſperates, but alſo indangers the breeding of new quarrels while they are debating the old

<hi>If thy Brother ſin againſt thee, tell him of it between thy ſelf and him:</hi> And interprets this ninth verſe thus (taking <hi>Aluph</hi> for a Prince, which we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>chief Friends</hi>) He that orderly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes him that erreth, cures him and makes no publick diſturbance; ſaves the man, and preſerves publick concord: but this order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected, thence ariſes out of brawlings, diſcords of Princes, wars and devaſtations.</p>
                  <p>[c] Now an evil man onely ſeeks ſcoldings or contentions (as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 11.) <hi>i. e.</hi> ſaith he, he doth not ſeek truth, nor the good of the Church; but troubles without end. Thus
<hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in the State, ſcattered ſeeds of war at <hi>Athens:</hi> the <hi>Cynicks</hi> and <hi>Academicks</hi> contradicted every body among the Philoſophers: and lately <hi>Valla, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Agrippa, Caroloſtadius,</hi> &amp;c. had the like ſcolding natures. Theſe ſeek not truth; but contradict things rightly ſpoken, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99434:147"/> move unneceſſary diſputes, and will not yield when they are admoniſhed, but with greater rage defend their errours. Of ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>it is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool in his folly.</hi> An example of which we meet withall, when we meet with a <hi>bewitched Papiſt,</hi> who defends the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt errours. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>But that which the Vulgar tranſlates <hi>ſemper jurgia quaerit malus,</hi> and we tranſlate, <hi>an evil man ſeeks onely rebellion,</hi> the moſt and the beſt Interpreters, take the other way, as the words lye more naturally in the Hebrew, <hi>a man very rebellious, ſeeks nothing but miſchief:</hi> which ſenſe I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe, together with the other.</p>
                  <p>[d] The truth of the next verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) is admirably opened by <hi>Bochartus</hi> (L. III. <hi>de Animal. Sacris,</hi> Cap. 9. Part. 1.) who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>four</hi> things concerning the
<hi>Bear,</hi> out of good Authours. The <hi>firſt</hi> every one knows, that a <hi>Bear</hi> is an exceeding fierce Creature: the <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that the <hi>Female</hi> is more fierce than the <hi>Male:</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> that ſhe is more fierce than ordinary, when ſhe hath Whelps: and
<hi>laſtly,</hi> that when ſhe is robbed of them ſhe is fierceſt of all, <hi>immanem in modum,</hi> even unto rage and madneſs. Which the Scripture takes notice of in two other places beſide this, 2. <hi> Sam.</hi> XVII. 8. XIII. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. where S. <hi>Hierome</hi> obſerves that the writers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99434:147"/> of natural Hiſtory ſay, among all wild Beaſts, none more fierce and cruel than the <hi>Bear,</hi> in two caſes eſpecially, when ſhe wants food, and when ſhe is robbed of her Whelps. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this laſt is there given by <hi>Kimchi;</hi> which well enough agrees with the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which the Wiſe man here makes:
<hi>for a Bear cannot be more in love with her Whelps, than a fool is with his abſurd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and reſolutions:</hi> and as a Bear falls upon the next perſon ſhe meets withall, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him for the robber; ſo doth a fool upon every one that ſtands in his way, though he be never ſo much obliged to them. He ſpares none in the heat of his paſſions, but furiouſly abuſeth them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what is expreſſed in the Paraphraſe upon
<hi>v.</hi> 17. concerning <hi>a Brother being born for Adverſity</hi> (which I have referred, as the beſt Interpreters do, unto a <hi>Friend</hi>) this may be added; as the plaineſt tranſlation of the Hebrew words. <hi>A true Friend</hi> (ſpoken of before) <hi>is born</hi> (that is, <hi>becomes</hi>)

                  <p>In the twenty fourth verſe I have put two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in which the words may be taken, into one. And that none may wonder at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the [h] ſame thing in the twenty fifth verſe, which was ſaid juſt before in the twenty firſt; I ſhall here obſerve: That there is no doubt but <hi>Solomon,</hi> having frequent occaſions to ſpeak of the ſame matter, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the words ſometimes, but not the ſenſe; and ſo the Collectours of his ſayings put down both. And he might ſpeak the oftner of this matter, having an example before his eyes of the great weakneſs of his own Son: who, it is not unlikely, was a perpetual grief to him. There is alſo ſomething obſervable in this verſe, which was not in the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the untowardneſs of Children have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99434:148"/> many times different effects upon the Parents: provoking the Fathers to anger and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Mothers to grief and ſorrow, to which their tenderneſs more inclines them than to the other paſſion.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ways alſo of expounding the latter end of the next verſe, <hi>v.</hi> 26. I have expreſſed the ſenſe of our Tranſlation; and had reſpect, in the next verſe to that (<hi>v.</hi> 27.) to both readings of the word which we render <hi>excellent.</hi>

And the laſt word in the firſt verſe, <hi>jith galla,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>intermedleth,</hi> he tranſlates <hi>is left deſolate.</hi> And then in the next verſe, taking <hi>behith galloth</hi> for <hi>wandring up and down;</hi> not for <hi>diſcovering,</hi> or <hi>revealing,</hi> as we do, the Paraphraſe will run thus.</p>
                  <p>V. 1. <hi>An unconſtant man deſires many things, and ſeeks ſatisfaction: but whatſoever he ſeeks, he never meets with it, but is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſappointed in all his deſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>And this is a certain character of a fool, that he never fixes in any thing: but chuſes rather to gad up and down, and rove from one inquiry to another; than give his mind to true wiſedom and prudence, in which he hath no pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> aims at this, I ſuppoſe, when he briefly expreſſes the ſenſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> thus, <hi>Pro deſiderio quaerit cerebroſus, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus immiſcet ſe,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If we take the word <hi>niphrad</hi> in a good ſenſe, then the Paraphraſe muſt run thus:</p>

                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:99434:154"/> 1. <hi>He that lives retired, and ſequeſters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ill company, and buſineſs, out of a true affection to wiſedom; endeavours to have a ſound knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of things.</hi>

                  <p>2. <hi>But a vain man addicts himſelf to his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for no other end; but onely to vapour with a ſhew of wiſedom, which he doth not love.</hi>

The words there run thus, <hi>Non recipit ſtultus verba prudentum, niſi ea dixeris quae verſantur in corde ejus.</hi> Which is commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of <hi>accommodating ones ſelf to the humour of a fool,</hi> who otherwiſe will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what is ſaid to him: but that great Man applies <hi>to the way of dealing with men, of corrupt minds and depraved judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                  <p>[d] Then after a caution to Judges (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) to ſearch into the merits of a cauſe; and not merely to look to the quality of the perſon that appears before them; he obſerves in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral verſes, the miſchief done by the tongue, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. In the laſt of which the word <hi>Mithlahamim</hi> being of uncertain ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

                  <p>[e] Rabbi <hi>Levi</hi> obſerves that in the tenth verſe there begins another ſort of precepts, of a different kind from thoſe that have been hitherto delivered from the beginning of the <hi>Tenth</hi> Chapter, to this place. All which have been in a manner, concerning the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch vices, as <hi>ſloth, hatred, anger, deceit, brawling, ſtrife, impiety;</hi> and other parts of that folly, againſt which he hath given many General cautions. But now he proceeds, as that <hi>Jewiſh Doctor</hi> thinks, to an Argument of another nature, directing men in the management of affairs of State, or in domeſtick buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is true in part, but not an exact Obſervation. For there are precepts, of the former kind, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed in the following Chapters, as any one may ſee that will reade them: and ſo there are ſeveral political maxims, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to different matters, in the Chapters foregoing. Even that obſervation which here immediately follows (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) concerning a rich man's confidence in his Wealth, rather than in the Divine Providence and protection, was delivered in part before X. 13. And the very next concerning pride and humility (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) in Chapt. XV. 33. and XVI. 18.

                  <p>[f] The thirteenth verſe is referred by ſome to Judges, who were anciently called <hi>Cognitores.</hi> And in good Authours
<hi>cognoſcere</hi> is as much as to doe the office of a Judge; who ought to take the greateſt care to know the truth, before he give a ſentence. For if it be a ſhame to a private perſon, in ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>to anſwer a matter before he heareth it;</hi> much more will it be to a Magiſtrate, if in matters of juſtice and judgment, he come to a reſolution, before he hath taken full cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of them.</p>
                  <p>[g] Some would connect the ſeventeenth verſe with the foregoing, but I have taken it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately. And there being ſeveral ways of interpreting it, either <hi>politically,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to cauſes brought before a Judge; or <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> with relation to what is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in a man's own Soul; I have followed our Tranſlation, which ſeems to me, neareſt to the Hebrew. In which a <hi>juſt man</hi> is not the perſon of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; but the mark of the Nominative Caſe (as <hi>Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> call it) is ſet before the word
<hi>firſt.</hi> So that it hath the ſame meaning with our vulgar ſaying;
<hi>One tale is good, till another be told:</hi> though I think there is more in it; and the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made this excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon it; which I have not neglected in my Paraphraſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:99434:156"/>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The firſt Information, ſays he, (<hi>Adv. of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Book VIII. Ch. 2. Parab. 17.) in any cauſe, if it a little fix it ſelf in the mind of the Judge, takes deep root, and wholly ſeaſons and prepoſſeſſes it: ſo as it can hardly be taken out, unleſs ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt falſhood be found in the matter of the Information; or ſome cunning dealing, in exhibiting, and laying open the ſame. For a bare and ſimple defence, though it be juſt and more weighty, can hardly compenſate the prejudice of the firſt Information, nor is of force in it ſelf, to reduce the ſcales of Juſtice, once ſwayed down, to an equal bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Wherefore it is the ſafeſt courſe for a Judge, that nothing touching the proofs and merit of the cauſe, be intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before hand; untill both Parties be heard together: And it is beſt for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, if he perceive the Judge to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupated, to labour principally in this (ſo far as the quality of the cauſe will admit) to diſcover ſome cunning ſhifts, and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent dealing, practiſed by the adverſe party, to the abuſe of the Judge."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They that expound this verſe (as the Ancients generally do) concerning private judgment, within a man's own ſoul, follow the LXX. and the vulgar Latine: and commonly make this the meaning. <hi>A good man, before he mind another man's faults, will firſt narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look to his own:</hi> and call himſelf to an
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99434:157"/> account, before he inquire after their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. This is an excellent ſenſe (if the words would bear it) which ſome of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> follow: even <hi>Melancthon</hi> himſelf, who thus tranſlates it, <hi>Juſtus initio eſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſator ſui, poſtea inquirit in alium:</hi> and runs into a long diſcourſe concerning ſelf-love, and mens blindneſs to their own faults, and quick-ſightedneſs in ſpying other mens; cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the known ſayings of
<hi>Catullus, Horace</hi> and <hi>Perſius</hi> to this purpoſe. But, though he take the <hi>juſt man</hi> here to be oppoſed to the <hi>hypocrite</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks of, who minds the more in his Brother's eye, and neglects the beam in his own yet, he acknowledges that the Greek word in the LXX belongs to the Law, and the civil Courts, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Which <hi>Verres</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> underſtood ſo well, that it was his common trick, <hi>to accuſe thoſe whom he had injured:</hi> for men are apt to favour the Plaintiff; ſuppoſing he cannot have the impudence to complain without a cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Nay, there are thoſe in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> that apply the vulgar Tranſlation this way; to this ſenſe. <hi>A juſt man is ſo prudent (as well as honeſt) as to relate all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99434:157"/> his cauſe ſincerely, without conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing; even accuſing himſelf if he be guilty: whereby he procures greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and prevents what his Adverſary would have ſaid; who, beſure, would have laid it open to his diſgrace, if he had craftily omitted any thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But I will not trouble the Reader with any other of their Interpretations; which are deviſed merely to make good that Tranſlation. The truth of ours may be further juſtified from the next, <hi>v.</hi> 18. which belongs to the matter of civil controverſies: which if the Judges could not determine, were referred to God's deciſion by lots.</p>
                  <p>[h] But I have ſaid enough, if not too much of this: and therefore ſhall onely obſerve a few reflexions which <hi>Melancthon</hi> makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Twenty-ſecond verſe.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as he paraphraſeth it, <hi>poor in diſcourſe, and reaſoning and knowledge</hi>) and relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plain ſimple words, is much better (and will in this way be ſaved, as in a ſmall Cogboat) than a Fool (for he is no better) that knows how to wind and turn every way in his diſcourſe; and moſt unlearnedly truſts
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99434:163"/> to his demonſtrations,"
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But this muſt be acknowledged not to be the literal ſenſe of the words, but onely an accommodation of them to his purpoſe: which was to repreſent <hi>how commendable ſimplicity is in Religion, and inquiries of Faith;</hi> as well as in all things elſe. Not that a man ſhould content himſelf to be ignorant, but onely, that he ſhould not be too curious and ſubtill in his diſquiſitions.</p>
                  <p>[b] For <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the next verſe, obſerves two great ſprings of all our miſcarriages; <hi>want of underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>want of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> To make too much haſte in a buſineſs, is the way not to ſpeed (according to the known Proverb) and to run blindly upon any thing, is no leſs prejudicial to us in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. That's the meaning of the firſt word, which we tranſlate <hi>alſo:</hi> both he that affects things without knowledge, and he that purſues what he underſtands, without delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: run into many miſtakes, and commit many ſins. So ſome render the word <hi>Nephes (Soul) the deſire of the Soul,</hi> the appetite, which muſt be always governed by prudence; or elſe it will run a man upon rocks, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate him into ruin. For which miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he ſhews in the next verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) he muſt blame none but himſelf; and never in the leaſt reflect upon his God, as if He were negligent of us, or hard to us: which men are prone to think, when they have foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly undone themſelves.</p>

                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:99434:164"/> [c] Then follows an obſervation, which he had made before, XIV. 20. but here repeats, in different words, over and over again, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 6, 7. For it is a lamentable thing to ſee how little true Friendſhip there is in the world; moſt men altering and changing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fortune (as we call it) of thoſe whom they pretend to love. If they be rich, they are courted by every body; but poverty ſhews how inſincerely. The Books of all ancient Authours are full of ſuch Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which I ſhall not ſo much as mention. [d] But note that in the midſt of theſe, he inſerts (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) an obſervation (which he had formerly made) of a greater wickedneſs in humane nature; which moves them either <hi>publickly</hi> to accuſe others falſly, or <hi>ſecretly</hi> to backbite them: neither of which ſhall eſcape unpuniſhed. For <hi>there is no word ſo ſecret that ſhall go for nought, and the mouth that belieth, ſlayeth the ſoul;</hi> as the <hi>Wiſedom of Solomon</hi> excellently ſpeaks I. 11. This is repeated alſo again in this very Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>v.</hi> 9. with the alteration onely of one word. The reaſon of which is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> (as I have noted before) uſing often the ſame axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms, ſometimes varied the phraſe, though not the ſenſe: and the Collectours of his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, thought good to ſet down his different forms of ſpeech, for the ſame thing. In both verſes, the <hi>LXX.</hi> plainly underſtand him to ſpeak of ſuch lies as are pernicious and burt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99434:164"/> to others: and in the latter of them, they take the <hi>deſtruction</hi> which the Wiſe man threatens unto ſuch liars, to ariſe from their own wicked words. And ſo I have expreſſed it in my Paraphraſe. There are thoſe, who think that this Sentence is repeated in the ninth verſe, as an admonition to the rich men ſpoken of in the verſes foregoing: who break their promiſes with thoſe that depend upon them; and give good words, when there is no need of them; but will doe no good, when men call for their aſſiſtance. Theſe ſhall ſuffer for their falſeneſs. But this ſeems to be ſtrain'd; and not agreeable to the meaning of the Hebrew Text.</p>
                  <p>[e] That which follows (<hi>v.</hi> 10.) is a notable admonition of the confuſed and diſordered ſtate of things, here in this preſent world: wherein we too often ſee men void of wit or goodneſs, wallowing in pleaſure; that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all things that can gratifie their ſenſes, which they pleaſe moſt abſurdly: and mean men getting into power, and lording it over their betters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſeemly, ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> and the latter of theſe more unſeemly than the former: but ſo it will be, unleſs men become wiſe and good; for moſt are made worſe by proſperity, which they know not how to uſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a true Rule of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> XXXIII.
<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 24. <hi>Fodder, a wand and burthens for an Aſs: and bread, correction
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99434:165"/> and work for a Slave.</hi> Every one is beſt in the condition that is proper for him: and therefore a Slave ſhould be kept under; and a brutiſh Sot be reſtrained from taking all his pleaſure. For no man is fit to govern another, that cannot govern himſelf, as the next verſe intimates: And the more power any man hath, the harder it is for him to command his paſſions: which may be ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the twelfth [f] verſe; for the <hi>young Lion,</hi> to whom a King is compared, as he is the ſtrongeſt, ſo is the fierceſt of all other.</p>
                  <p>From hence the Wiſe man paſſes to ſome dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick obſervations <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 18, 19. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which if I ſhould make any remarks, it would extend this Preface beyond its juſt bounds. The skilfull Reader will ſee where I have put two ſenſes together: which I could not do in the twenty third verſe; and therefore ſhall here give a ſhort account of it.</p>
                  <p>[g] All Interpreters, except one, underſtand it as our Tranſlation hath rendred it; by ſupplying a word before, <hi>abideth ſatisfied.</hi> Onely <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> thinks the parts of this verſe are oppoſite; as the reſt uſe to be: and by that word which we tranſlate <hi>ſatisfied</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>full</hi> in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) underſtands proud and haughty people (as they who are rich are too prone to be) who are here oppoſed to him that fears God; as they are in
<hi>Luk.</hi> I. 50, 51, 53. And the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:99434:165"/> Paraphraſe will run thus; <hi>He that is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a religious ſenſe of God, that he fears to offend Him, is a moſt happy man: but he that is ſwoln with pride and forgets God, when worldly goods flow in upon him, ſhall lie down at laſt in ſorrow; and never want ſomething or other to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him.</hi> And ſomething of this ſenſe the LXX. ſeem to have had in their mind; who make the members of this verſe oppoſite, as he doth; underſtanding by
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>full,</hi> he that hath no fear of God. For ſo their Tranſlation runs; <hi>the fear of the Lord is to a man's life,</hi>

<hi>but he that is without fear</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of God) <hi>ſhall abide in places, where there is no knowledge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him, i. e.</hi> run blindly into all manner of miſchief.</p>
                  <p>[h] The next verſe is a moſt elegant, but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical, deſcription of a man that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up himſelf to ſloth: who refuſes to doe things, as <hi>eaſie</hi> as to pull his hand out of his boſome; and as <hi>neceſſary</hi> as to eat and drink. This being the plain ſenſe, I have not varied from the common tranſlation of the word
<hi>zalláchath;</hi> which every where ſignifies a pot, or diſh, or ſomething like it; and can onely by a metaphor be applied to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or arm-holes. But we muſt either ſo underſtand it, or elſe take the firſt word <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hide,</hi> in a very improper ſenſe: for there can be no cauſe for hiding the hand in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99434:166"/> a pot. Therefore we muſt either tranſlate it as we do; or elſe underſtand by <hi>hide,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or thruſting the hand into the pot or diſh; and thus tranſlate the whole verſe: <hi>A ſluggard puts his hand into the diſh; but will not ſo much as move it from thence unto his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[i] The next verſe, as <hi>Melancthon</hi> well notes, is an obſervation, concerning the way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the world. Some are ſo bad, they muſt be handled with great ſharpneſs: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch profane men, as with an Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an contempt deride admonition, and grow thereby more furious. But there are thoſe who grow better, even by the examples of ſeverity againſt notorious Offenders: As the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> came and ſought peace, when they ſaw their neighbours deſtroyed; and the puniſhment of <hi>Siſamnes</hi> made <hi>Otanes</hi> more cautious, when he was placed in the Seat covered with his Predeceſſour's skin; as
<hi>Herodotus</hi> relates in his <hi>Terpſichore.</hi> But then there are a
<hi>third</hi> ſort, who need not ſo much; but being admoniſhed, are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thoſe that tell them of their faults. To ſuch a reproof, at the moſt, is ſufficient.</p>

                  <p>[a] The firſt precept in this Chapter is againſt
<hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> as an enemy to Wiſedom, even in common things; much more in thoſe of everlaſting conſequence: For that it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expells out of mens minds all reverence both to God, and to others, inclining them to take the licenſe to ſay or doe any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint or diſcretion; and what unruly paſſions it excites when the brain is diſturbed with it; is known to all, and need not be here recited. The word
<hi>Homeh</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> here uſes, and which we render
<hi>raging</hi> or outragious, includes them all: ſignifying that diſcompoſed, unquiet and reſtleſs ſtate of mind; which expreſſes it ſelf in ſome wild motion or other, according as men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined. But nothing worſe can be ſaid of it, than this that it makes men either ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſots, or profane ſcoffers at Religion and all ſobriety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:99434:172"/> [b] Next to this he adviſes every man to take heed, how he ſuffers himſelf to be drunk with anger. For nothing elſe but an intoxication therewith, can make a man ſo diſtracted, as to fly in the face of Majeſty. For ſo that word <hi>hithabber</hi> properly ſignifies, not to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> the King (though moſt Interpreters, even <hi>Bochartus</hi> himſelf, ſo render it) but to <hi>be angry</hi> at him: which is a kind of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For thereby he is provoked to ſuch fury, as is in young Lions, who are the fierceſt of all others. I have therefore expreſſed both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the word.</p>
                  <p>[c] In the next verſe I take <hi>iſh</hi> to ſignifie a more than ordinary man; one of the higheſt rank; and that in Wiſedom: For it is oppoſed to a fool; and therefore ſo I have expounded it.</p>
                  <p>[d] As I have alſo underſtood it in <hi>v.</hi> 5. where
<hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves that there are no men ſo cunning, but there are others as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til to find them out. Concerning which Art of finding out men, the Great <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> hath given many notable rules (in his
<hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Chapter of the VIII Book of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning</hi>) for though the knowledge it ſelf falls not under precepts, becauſe it is of Individuals; yet inſtructions for the deducing of it may be given. And he obſerves <hi>ſix</hi> ways whereby the knowledge of men may be drawn out and diſcloſed. By their faces and countenances; by words; by deeds; by their nature; by their ends; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99434:173"/> by the relations of others. What he ſays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe heads, the Reader may there find. I ſhall onely mention this ſingle obſervation of his; That <hi>the weakeſt and ſimpleſt ſort of men, are beſt interpreted by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (according to which they commonly act) <hi>but the wiſeſt and moſt reſerved, are beſt expounded by their ends and aims.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] The next verſe is very variouſly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but our Tranſlation ſeems to come neareſt to the ſenſe of the Hebrew words: Which may admit alſo of this conſtruction; which approaches nearer than any other, beſide that which we follow. <hi>It is the common inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, when they are in need or danger, to call for relief or help from him, whom they have obliged: but there are very few, that in ſuch a condition will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to be faithfull friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[f] The <hi>eleventh</hi> verſe alſo may be expounded quite contrary ways. Becauſe the word <hi>ith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakker</hi> ſignifies both to
<hi>make ones ſelf known,</hi> and to <hi>make ones ſelf a ſtranger,</hi> unto others. All the ancient Interpreters follow, as ours doth, the firſt ſenſe; which ſeems moſt genuine: for Nature commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays its inclinations in children ſo plainly, and they are ſo ſtrong and violent, that they cannot diſſemble them. Yet that (which is the other) is no abſurd ſenſe; which ſome give of theſe words, <hi>Even children are ſo cunning, as to hide their inclinations: and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99434:173"/> therefore it is not eaſie to gueſs in their childhood, what they will prove when they come to man's eſtate.</hi> But this is not ſo common as the other.</p>
                  <p>[g] The next verſe ſome good Interpreters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound wholly, concerning the happineſs a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is in, when the Subjects are ſo humble, that they are inclined meekly to obey their Superiours; and their Superiours ſo wiſe, that they ſolicitouſly provide for their ſafety and good Government. Thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> obſerves, that in Government theſe two things muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; Good Counſel in the Governours, and Obedience in the People: both of which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> acknowledges to be the gift of God. Nay, both theſe, ſaith he, muſt concur in a King; who muſt not onely have good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, but be inclined alſo to hearken to them; or elſe he will not be happy. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was an excellent Monitor, but
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> would not be ruled by him; and ſo <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was deſtroyed: as on the other ſide, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in former times, hearkned to <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah,</hi> and then it was preſerved. <hi>Haec eſt principalis ſententia, hujus dulciſſimi dicti.</hi> But I rather look upon this to be, that which they call a tropical ſenſe, not the literal; and therefore I onely note it here, together with this wholeſome Admonition of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour which follows: <hi>That Kingdoms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well governed onely by humane Wiſedom; but the Aſſiſtance of God muſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99434:174"/> be implored, both in giving of counſel, and in bowing the wills of men to Obedience, and in governing events.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[h] The <hi>fourteenth</hi> verſe is alledged by the Lord
<hi>Bacon,</hi> as an Inſtance of one of the mere colours of good and evil: teaching us that all is not good which men praiſe; nor all bad which they diſcommend. For as <hi>faud,</hi> the wiſe man here obſerves, makes them diſpraiſe that, to which they have a mind: ſo in other caſes, out of
<hi>ignorance,</hi> or out of <hi>partiality,</hi> or <hi>faction,</hi> nay ſometimes from <hi>natural diſpoſition,</hi> men both diſparage that which is praiſe-worthy, and commend that which is good for little.</p>
                  <p>But there are other Authours, who give a quite different ſenſe of theſe words; particularly <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Melancthon:</hi> who by <hi>koneh</hi> do not underſtand a
<hi>buyer;</hi> but an <hi>owner</hi> or <hi>poſſeſſor.</hi> And imagine the meaning of this Proverb to be, that <hi>men are not wont to like that which they enjoy; but after God hath taken it away from them, then they commend the happineſs they have loſt.</hi> The laſt named Writer, heaps up abundance of excellent ſentences out of the Ancients, like this of
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the preſent is always grievous.</hi> Which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of ſickleneſs and inconſtancy; or becauſe they are cloyed with what they have long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; or are impatient of ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in their preſent ſtate; but chiefly out
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99434:174"/> of inconſideration, that all conditions will have ſomething troubleſome in them; and out of great unthankfulneſs to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of his Providence, which diſpoſes things better than we can do our ſelves. But the word
<hi>jithhallel,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>boaſt,</hi> ſcarce admits of this ſenſe; and therefore I have not taken notice of it in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                  <p>[i] Whether <hi>peninim</hi> in the next verſe, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Rubies, or Pearls, or any other ſort of precious ſtone, or none in particular, is not very material: but <hi>Bochart</hi> I think hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that it ſignifies Pearls (Part II. L. V. C. 6. <hi>de Sacr. An.</hi>) and therefore I have ſo tranſlated it. And it is not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent argument, which he alledges for this (cap. 8.) that Wiſedom in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is frequently compared to Pearls, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them; as it is here in this place.</p>
                  <p>[k] In the <hi>ſeventeenth</hi> verſe, under the name of
<hi>bread of deceit,</hi> may be comprehended all things got wrongfully: which though they may pleaſe a man in the beginning, will bring ſorrow and pain in the concluſion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo I have expreſſed it in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>
                  <p>[l] There is little difficulty in the verſes that follow till we come to the 25 verſe. Where the vulgar Latin hath been ſo extremely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that various interpretations have thence ariſen of a very plain ſentence, as the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99434:175"/> words run in the Hebrew. Which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> as <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters univerſally acknowledge. <hi>A corruption</hi> (ſaith Mr.
<hi>Cartwright</hi> himſelf) <hi>which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more infeſted the World than in this age: in which moſt men, not onely give nothing; but doe all they can to take away from that which their Anceſtors have given ☞ to the ſervice of God, and the ſupport of his Miniſters, of Schools, or of the Poor. By which they are guilty not onely of their own deſtruction; but of the loſs of the ſouls of others.</hi> The onely difference between them herein is, that ſome take the words to be a cenſure of the <hi>hypocritical wickedneſs</hi> of ſuch, as after they have committed ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and ſuch like ſins, think to make God an amends by Vows, and Sacrifices, and Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and among the Reformed (as they are called) <hi>de Dieu,</hi> who adds this new conjecture, that the firſt word <hi>Mokeſch</hi> may be interpreted <hi>by a ſnare, i. e.</hi> fraudulently and craftily; and then the ſenſe is this: <hi>A ſacrilegious man finds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to rob God, of things that are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Him: and then makes vows, in hope by them to expiate his ſacrilege.</hi> The whole ſentence he alſo obſerves may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſpoſed: but it ſeems to be ſo forced and unuſual that I ſhall not mention it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:99434:175"/> [m] The like variety of interpretations, the miſtake of the Vulgar Latin hath produced in the next verſe. Which ſeems to intend no more than this, That <hi>a Good King ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the bad from the good, by a due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Laws: which is like the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing of the corn, after the chaff is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it, by drawing the wheel over it.</hi> For as the flail is the Inſtrument among us of beating the corn out of the husk; ſo in thoſe hot Countries, they made this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a wheel drawn by Oxen over it: which both preſſed out the corn, and broke the ſtraw; as may be ſeen in XXVIII <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 28. and many other places, which our learned Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>N. Fuller</hi> hath explained in his
<hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies</hi> (L. VI. Cap. 12.) and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> hath applied to that place of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt LXXVIII. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. though it ſeemed to me there, to have another meaning.</p>

                  <p>This Chapter begins with a Sentence, which
<hi>Themiſtius,</hi> a Pagan Philoſopher and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, ſeems to take notice of, and mention as very memorable in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (as he is ſuppoſed to call the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) Writings: and commends to the thoughts of the Emperour <hi>Valens,</hi> in a ſpeech he made to him
<hi>Orat.</hi> IX. But if he had reſpect to this Proverb of
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s, he did not fully comprehend the ſenſe of it; for he takes notice onely of a Prince's mind being in the cuſtody, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guard of God. For thus he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the mind of the King is kept in ſafe cuſtody in the hand of God.</hi> From whence he draws this Inference, that a King ought to be very ſenſible what danger he is in, if he go about any thing contrary to the mind of God; becauſe he then is in peril to fall out of the hand, which preſerves and keeps him. Nay, thou oughtſt, O King (ſaith he) not onely to deſign nothing thy ſelf, but what is holy; but they that are about thee ought to ſpeak to thee nothing that is not ſo: For every word that comes to thy ears, is written in his uncorrupted hand. But though
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99434:184"/> this be a moſt excellent Admonition, worthy to be written in the hearts of all Princes, <hi>that it is very unbecoming to have any evil thing, any thing impure, or in the leaſt blemiſhed with cruelty or inhumanity, in that heart, which thoſe moſt holy and moſt gracious and benign hands of God, carry in their keeping;</hi> yet there is a great deal more than theſe <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Letters or Pictures, which he ſpeaks of, expreſs. For <hi>Solomon</hi> would have them, and us, ſenſible that <hi>they cannot manage things by their power, as they think good;</hi> but depend upon an higher cauſe, who orders all their motions, good and bad, to ſuch ends as He propoſes to himſelf; quite contrary to their intentions and inclinations. Which is an Inſtruction ſufficient <hi>to correct the pride of the moſt abſolute Monarch, and the impatience of the moſt oppreſſed Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[b] Next to which follows (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) a caution againſt thinking too well of our ſelves: which had been delivered before (XVI. 2.) but for the weightineſs, I ſuppoſe, of the matter, and the proneneſs of men to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not to judge ſincerely of their own actions, is here again repeated.</p>
                  <p>And then there is a caution added (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) againſt Hypocriſie; which thinks to pleaſe God with ceremonies, without moral honeſty.</p>
                  <p>[c] In the <hi>fourth</hi> verſe the meaning is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uncertain, from the different acceptions
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99434:184"/> of the word <hi>ner</hi> or
<hi>nir:</hi> which the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> and other Interpreters, tranſlate not <hi>ploughing,</hi> or <hi>ploughed fields;</hi> but the <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>ſplendour</hi> of the wicked. I have had reſpect to both ſenſes; underſtanding by <hi>ploughing,</hi> the ſtudy, contrivance and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wicked men. And the Sentence may be inverted, in this manner: <hi>ſin is the pride, the ambition, the glory and joy</hi> (or the <hi>buſineſs</hi>) <hi>of wicked men.</hi> That, upon which they value themſelves, and for which they think themſelves brave fellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, that they dare doe wickedly: or we may make two Sentences of this verſe, to this purpoſe; <hi>men that have proud and lofty thoughts, have very ambitious deſires and an unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appetite; which put them upon much wickedneſs: nay, the very buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all wicked men (as well as their pleaſure) is nothing but ſin.</hi> And this word <hi>ner</hi> ſignifying a <hi>yoke,</hi> among the <hi>Chaldaeans, Syrians</hi> and <hi>Arabians, Lud. de Dieu</hi> thinks this no improper ſenſe: <hi>ſuperciliouſneſs, and ſwelling of the heart</hi> (or mind) <hi>is a yoke intolerable; and proper to the wicked. Caſtalio</hi> alone underſtands by <hi>ſin,</hi> the effects of ſin; to this ſenſe:
<hi>pride, and haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind are deadly enemies to that happineſs, and pleaſure, which the wicked purſue:</hi> for inſtead of making them greater, as they fancy, they lay them low in all mens opinions, and expoſe them to their hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I omit other Interpretations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:99434:185"/> [d] In the <hi>ſeventh</hi> verſe there are different opinions about the force of the word <hi>jegorem:</hi> moſt of which I have endeavoured to expreſs in the Paraphraſe. And there is no little obſcurity in the next verſe: but beſides that ſenſe which I have repreſented, the words are capable of another, which is as plain; viz. <hi>as the man is, ſo are his works; a man of tricks will act ſtrangely (quite different from all the rules whereby we ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our ſelves) but an honeſt man, you may know where to have; for he acts conformable to the Laws of righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] In the <hi>eleventh</hi> verſe, <hi>de Dieu</hi> thinks both parts of it, ought to be referred to one and the ſame ſubject, viz.
<hi>peti,</hi> the <hi>ſimple:</hi> who, ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> (according to this conſtruction of the words) may be inſtructed two ways. One is, by the puniſhments which are inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a Scorner; which works upon his fear: the other is, when he attends to the wiſe, and obſerves God's great goodneſs to him; which works upon his love. Wherein he ſeems to have reſpect alſo to another ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word <hi>bemaſchil,</hi> beſides that of attending to information and inſtruction: for it ſometimes imports that happineſs and proſperity, wherewith God bleſſes the wiſe and prudent. But that ſenſe which I have followed in the Paraphraſe, ſeems neareſt to the Hebrew: and agrees beſt with what was ſaid before, XIX. 25. And it being uſual,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99434:185"/> in this Book, to repeat the ſame Sentence, in divers places, in different words; I have therefore kept to that ſenſe. But if any like the other (which the Vulgar Lat. alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, making both parts of the Sentence to reſpect <hi>the ſimple</hi>) the plaineſt interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter part of it, ſeems to me to be this:
<hi>when Inſtruction is given to the wiſe, the ſimple alſo learn ſomething; by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how diligently even the wiſe hearken to it.</hi> And in this ſenſe the word <hi>Maſchil,</hi> with <hi>lamed</hi> after it, is uſed in the next verſe; <hi>the juſt conſiders the houſe of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[f] Which, though it ſeem very plain, yet there are great varieties in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: becauſe of the following part of the verſe. In which many put in the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> to ſupply the ſenſe (as we do) but without any neceſſity; there being a clear and obvious ſenſe, (which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Paraphraſe) without any ſuch ſupplement; if we do but take the <hi>juſt man</hi> for a juſt Magiſtrate, and not for a private perſon.</p>
                  <p>[g] There is little difficulty after this, till we come to the
24<hi>th</hi> verſe: where he either gives this character of a Scorner, that he is proud and arrogant, and does all things in the <hi>wrath of his pride</hi> (as the words are in the Hebrew) or deſcribes the proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant man to be a Scorner alſo, and full of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:99434:186"/> haughty wrath. It is not of much concern, which way we take it; for the ſenſe will, in a manner, be the ſame. I have expreſſed the Hebrew, as near as I could, in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe; taking the conſtruction thus: <hi>A proud and haughty perſon, who may well be called a ſcorner, proceeds furiouſly, and unſufferably in all that he doeth.</hi>

<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>they are both alike the workmanſhip of God, though in external regards they be unequal.</hi> Which ought to ſhame rich men into ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and brotherly kindneſs towards them; that when they are apt to be lifted up becauſe of thoſe things wherein they are unequal, they may be taken down again and become more moderate; when they conſider how in the greateſt things they are both alike.</p>
                  <p>But I have had a reſpect to the other thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in my Paraphraſe: becauſe, if God did not
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:99434:193"/> intend, in the beginning, ſo great a diſparity as we now ſee (which this is not a place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) yet ſome diſparity, it may be eaſily proved, he did deſign; the mean condition, that is (though not beggary) of ſome, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with others. Which ſerves many wiſe ends of his Providence: nay, beggary may be very uſefull, to give the greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of liberality on the one hand, and of patience, humility, and honeſt diligence on the other. And to be commended for theſe vertues, is much better than to be rich, as he obſerves, in the firſt verſe. Where <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon,</hi> hath a large diſcourſe to ſhow that it is lawfull, nay neceſſary, to endeavour after a good fame: according to that ſaying, <hi>I have need of a good conſcience, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God, and of a good name for the ſake of my neighbours.</hi> And he alledges ſome ancient ſentences to the ſame purpoſe with this of <hi>Solomon;</hi> as that of <hi>Publius, Honeſtus rumor alterum patrimonium eſt:</hi> and that of <hi>Plautus, Honeſtam famam ſi ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſo, ſat ero dives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[b] There are more obſervations about riches, in <hi>v.</hi>
7, 8, 9. which ſeem to me to have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance one upon the other; and ſo I have conſidered them in the Paraphraſe. And in the next verſe but one (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the judgment of <hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> who thinks <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves two fruits of pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; one, that the word of ſuch a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:99434:194"/> man may be relied on; and the other, that the King (who loves not to be deceived) will be his Friend, upon that account. This ſeems neareſt to the Hebrew; unleſs we will take it thus: Two things recommend a man to the affection of a Prince, his
<hi>Integrity,</hi> and his <hi>Eloquence:</hi> which make him very capable to doe his Prince ſervice. And then the Paraphraſe muſt run thus: <hi>He that loves ſincerity above all things, and is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his mind in acceptable language, is fit to be Privy Counſellor to a King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] And to this, I conceive, he hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the next verſe; where by <hi>Dáath Knowledge,</hi> in the firſt part of it, we are to underſtand (the other part of the verſe ſhows) <hi>men truly knowing, and who ſpeak according to their knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[d] In the 13 verſe, there is an admirable deſcription of the diſpoſition of ſlothfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who raiſe difficulties in their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, where there are none; or, pretending them greater than they are, will not ſo much as attempt any thing, becauſe it is poſſible they may meet with inſuperable hindrances. Which ſome have, not unfitly, applied, to cowardly Magiſtrates, who dare not puniſh great and powerfull offenders; but excuſe themſelves, ſaying, <hi>He is a mighty man, there is no dealing with him,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas a Worthy Magiſtrate (as an excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of our own, Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſpeaks)
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:99434:194"/> would meet with ſuch a <hi>Lion</hi> to chuſe; that he might make <hi>God's Ordinance</hi> to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, and clear the way for others, by tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſuch a beaſt</hi> in pieces:
<hi>and would no more fear to make a Worſhipfull Thief, or a Right Worſhipfull Murtherer (if ſuch a one ſhould come in his circuit) an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Juſtice; than to twitch up a poor ſheep-ſtealer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> applies it, no leſs wittily, to the lazineſs of Mankind, in the <hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning</hi> (L. 1. C. ult.) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome things being ſo abſtruſe, that it is impoſſible to be compaſſed by humane induſtry. Whereas <hi>all thoſe things are to be held poſſible and performable, which may be accompliſhed by ſome perſons, though not by every one; and which may be done by the united labours of many, though not by any one apart; and which may be effected in a ſucceſſion of Ages, though not in the ſame age; and in brief, which may be finiſhed by the publick care and charge, though not by the abilities and induſtry of particular perſons.</hi> But there is no excuſe for thoſe, who will not ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any enquiries; becauſe ſome things cannot be known. Which is perfectly the temper of the ſluggard, <hi>Solomon</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who becauſe a <hi>Lion</hi> ſometimes comes into the ſtreet, would not ſtir out of his doors. It was not ordinary, you muſt know, for <hi>Lions</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:99434:195"/> to come into Towns; no, nor to rove in the day-time (the night being their ſeaſon, CIV <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.) But ſometimes by the divine vengeance they were ſtirred up to leave the deſerts, and go into inhabited places (V <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>King.</hi> XVII. 25, 26.) and likewiſe (if we may believe the great Philoſopher in his
<hi>Hiſtory of Animals</hi>) when they grow old,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>Pliny,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> obſerves, L. III. C. 2. Part 1.</p>
                  <p>[e] In the Sixteenth verſe I have followed our Tranſlation, and expreſſed the ſenſe to as much advantage as I could. But I think the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> and ſome others follow, comes nearer to the Hebrew, which runs thus: <hi>He that ſqueezes the poor to increaſe his own eſtate, gives to the rich</hi> (not to ſecure what he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but) <hi>onely to impoveriſh it:</hi> That is, He ſhall be ſqueezed by ſome mightier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than himſelf. And ſo the Paraphraſe, in more words, ſhould be this:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Now from this verſe, there is ſcare any Inter preter but hath obſerved, another form of ſpeech, much different from the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and continues unto the XXV Chapter: And therefore it may not unfitly be called, <hi>The Second Part of the Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the beginning of the <hi>Tenth</hi> Chapter to this place, the Inſtructions of Wiſedom are delivered in ſhort ſentences, and <hi>Proverbs</hi> properly ſo called; which have ſeldom any connexion one with another, or not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:99434:196"/> ſhowing what is good or bad, true or falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now follows Exhortations, and Precepts, in the
<hi>Imperative Mode</hi> of ſpeech, and thoſe comprehended in <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> or more verſes, before he finiſh what he intends. In which alteration, ſome think the weakneſs of the Reader is conſulted: who being weary of the ſententious way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, may be refreſhed and awakened unto new attention, by varying the form of writing. And thus the ſon of <hi>Syrack</hi> after his <hi>gnomae</hi> or ſentences, adds an earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the ſtudy of Wiſedom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, like this of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> in the following <hi>Section,</hi> which I call his
<hi>Second Part.</hi> Which may have reſpect both to that which went before; and to that which follows: as if he had ſaid, let not all that hath been ſaid be loſt, or ſuperficially regarded; but take a ſerious Review of the foregoing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and give ear alſo to what I have further to deliver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[f] And to more the greater attention, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends them (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) under the name of <hi>Schaliſchim, words fit for a Prince to ſpeak, and the beſt men in the world to hear:</hi> which we truly therefore render <hi>excellent things.</hi> There is another notion of the word, I know; which I have not altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: but it always ſignifying in the <hi>Bible,</hi> either <hi>great Captains,</hi> and
<hi>Commanders,</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> or the <hi>beſt ſort of Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:99434:196"/> (as it doth in one place) I look upon this as the moſt proper Interpretation of it.</p>
                  <p>[g] And among thoſe <hi>Principal Rules</hi> of life, he firſt commends this <hi>v.</hi> 22. not to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to poor people: eſpecially by oppreſſing them in a form of Juſtice. Which all know was adminiſtred by the Elders <hi>in the gate</hi> of their City; as may be ſeen in many more places, beſides that, which I have noted in the Paraphraſe XXI <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. XXII. 9. XXV. 7. IV <hi>Ruth</hi> 1, 2,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being ſo common a notion, it is ſtrange that the Greek Interpreters ſhould here underſtand this verſe of <hi>poor people begging at their doors:</hi> whom the Wiſe man admoniſhes them not to abuſe. This ſeems to be their ſenſe: but the word <hi>Tedakkee</hi> ſignifies more than <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>diſhonour</hi> or <hi>abuſe,</hi> (which is the word whereby the LXX expreſs it) for it denotes as much, as to <hi>cruſh,</hi> and that
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bits,</hi> i. e. to undoe people utterly; which no body is inclined to doe, unto poor wretches begging at their doors: who are undone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>[h] Then follows a moſt neceſſary advice about the choice of a Friend, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. upon which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath paſſed this judicious remark; (<hi>Advanc. of Learning,</hi> B. VIII. Ch. II. Par. 26.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"By how much the more devoutly the Laws of Friendſhip among good men are to be obſerved; by ſo much
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:99434:197"/> the more it ſtands us upon to uſe all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even at the very firſt, in the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Election of Friends.
<hi>And let the diſpoſition and humours of our Friends be what they will, ſo far as concerns our ſelves onely, they are by all means to be born withall: but when they impoſe a neceſſity upon us, to behave our ſelves juſt as they would have us towards other men, it is a very hard, and unreaſonable condition of Friendſhip.</hi> Wherefore it highly concerns us, as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes, for the preſerving of the peace and ſafety of our life, that we intermingle not our matters with men of a cholerick nature: and ſuch as eaſily provoke, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake Quarrels, and Debates. For ſuch kind of Friends will perpetually engage us in contentions and factions: ſo that we ſhall be conſtrained either to break off Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or to be wanting to our own perſonal ſafety."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[i] In the two next verſes (<hi>v.</hi> 26, 27.) he ſeems to warn men againſt ſuch Friendſhips, as will engage them to be bound for the debts of others. There are ſeveral Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions before, againſt being ſurety for a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> VI. 1. XI. 15. and in one place (XVII. 18.) he ſeems to caution againſt raſh engagements, though for a
<hi>neighbour</hi> or <hi>friend:</hi> but eſpecially, he here adds, when a man is conſcious to himſelf that he hath no
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99434:197"/> eſtate, and doth but deceive him to whom he ſtands bound for another man's debt: And ſo, by pretending to be more able than he is, deprives himſelf of the benefit of that Law mentioned XXII <hi>Exod.</hi> 26, 27. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated XXIV <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>[k] What is ſaid in the 28 verſe againſt the removing of the <hi>Boundaries</hi> whereby one man's poſſeſſions are diſtinguiſhed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that by ancient conſent; is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by all ſorts of Writers, as a caution againſt innovations. And it is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to imagine, that onely <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authours make that uſe of it: for the beſt of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> have thought fit to accommodate it to the ſame purpoſe. And among the reſt
<hi>Melancthon</hi> hath very judiciouſly explained it, in this manner.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"This Precept is not obſcure, if it be cited allegorically for <hi>not changing the Laws, which Antiquity by Grave Authority hath delivered; unleſs there be an evident neceſſity.</hi> For this is often repeated among the precepts of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical life, not <hi>raſhly to change the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws.</hi> And here he quotes a long paſſage out of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> againſt <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> concerning the people of <hi>Locri;</hi> who ordained that <hi>he who propoſed a new Law to them, ſhould doe it with an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his neck,</hi> &amp;c. And if there were ſuch ſeverity now, ſaith
<hi>Melancthon,</hi> we ſhould not have ſo many new <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:99434:198"/> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s, about Wax-candles, and Bells, and ſuch-like things; of whoſe change, as there is no neceſſity at all, ſo it would bring no utility. And wiſe men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us <hi>to pardon and indulge ſome ſmall inconveniences to cuſtom;</hi> leſt by motion, as it is in ſick bodies, the Commonwealth ſhould ſuffer a greater evil. It is neceſſary indeed here to add this caution, when any Doctrine is impious, and the Law eſtabliſhes impious opinions and Idols, <hi>then we ought to prefer Rules before them, and to obey God rather than man.</hi> But when ſuch amendment is neceſſary, the boundaries and limits of our Fathers are <hi>not taken away, but reſtored:</hi> becauſe we onely return to the Doctrine delivered by God to our firſt Father, according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Primum quodque veriſſimum eſt. All our care therefore herein is to enquire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, what is the true Antiquity:</hi> for that is a great confirmation of our Faith, when we underſtand the true ſtate of the Church in all Ages, to follow the teſtimony of thoſe who retain the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[l] In the laſt verſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not merely commend Induſtry and Diligence, as ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it (taking this to be the ſame with the Greek Proverb, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) but ſomething more; which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
<hi>Mahir</hi> plainly imports, viz. <hi>ſpeed, ſwiftneſs,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99434:198"/> readineſs,</hi> and
<hi>cheerfulneſs,</hi> in the diſpatch of buſineſs. To which is required a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion in diſcerning the fitteſt means, and a dexterity in the application of them: ſo that the buſineſs is not onely done, but done ſpeedily, and without much noiſe and buſtle. On ſuch a perſon, if he can be found, <hi>Solomon</hi> here makes this remark, that he is likely to come to great preferment.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"For there are no qualities (as is obſerved by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> B. VIII. Ch. II. Parab. XIX.) which Princes more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and require in the choice of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or Servant, than celerity and alacrity in the diſpatch of buſineſs: which is above all the reſt, as he ſhows, by this induction. Men of <hi>profound Wiſedom,</hi> are many times ſuſpected by Kings as too prying; and able by the ſtrength of their wit (as with an Engine) to turn and wind about their Maſters, inſenſibly, whether they will or no. Then <hi>popular perſons</hi> are hated, as thoſe that ſtand in the light of Kings, and draw the eyes of the people too much unto themſelves. <hi>Men of courage,</hi> are commonly taken for turbulent ſpirits, and more daring than is meet. <hi>Honeſt men,</hi> who are valuable for their integrity, are thought too ſtiff; not ſo pliable as their Maſters deſire, to their will and pleaſure in every thing. To conclude, ſaith he, there is not any other good quality, which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:99434:199"/> preſents not ſome ſhaddow, wherewith the mind of Kings may be offended: <hi>onely quickneſs of diſpatch, in the execution of commands, hath nothing in it, that doth not pleaſe.</hi> The motions alſo of the minds of Kings are ſwift, and not very patient of delays. <hi>For they imagine they can doe any thing: this onely being wanting, that it be done out of hand.</hi>

                  <p>[a] As the foregoing Chapter concludes with an obſervation, concerning the quality of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is moſt likely to come to preferment; ſo this begins with a caution to him, when he is promoted to it. For the firſt verſe is (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> calls it) <hi>Aulica Admonitio,</hi> an Admonition to a Courtier; remembring him, that there is danger, even in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, eſpecially in the familiarity of Princes and great men. Whoſe kindneſs muſt be uſed, with much modeſty and circumſpection: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be ſo extraordinary kind, as to admit an inferiour to eat with them: when if a man uſe not great moderation, he loſes the guard he ought to have upon himſelf. For his head growing hot, his tongue may run, as we ſay, before his wit; his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our may be indecent, or too negligent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be very conſiderate at that time, above all others; and with earneſt attention to mind both <hi>who</hi> and
<hi>what</hi> is before him: (for the Hebrew wards may refer to both, as I have explained it in the Paraphraſe) there being great danger of his ruin, if he give any offence, at ſuch a time; when the paſſions
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99434:205"/> of the Prince or Ruler, are apt to be as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, as his own. And therefore had need be watched, that he may know how to appeaſe them preſently; and ſo govern himſelf, as to receive no prejudice thereby.</p>
                  <p>[b] But eſpecially he muſt be ſure to have a command over his tongue (which <hi>Melancthon</hi> takes to be the meaning of
<hi>putting a knife to his throat,</hi> v. 2.) that it take not too much liberty, and that he ſpeak nothing raſhly: which may undoe him, as it did
<hi>Clitus;</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> ſlew at a Feaſt, for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting him too freely. He cites many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions out of the Poets, concerning this danger; concluding with that counſel which <hi>Aeſop</hi> gave <hi>Solon,</hi> when he was going to <hi>Croeſus;</hi> ſpeak to a King, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>But this is too narrow a ſenſe of that phraſe, <hi>put a knife to thy throat;</hi> though it be a part of it. For it expreſſes the exceeding great caution, a man ſhould uſe at a Feaſt leſt he exceed his bounds in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: wherein he ſhould be as carefull, as he is of cutting his throat; which many have in effect done by intemperance: whereby ſome have utterly deſtroyed their healths at laſt; and others faln into ſuch a liberty of ſpeech, as hath on a ſudden coſt them their lives. Be as affraid therefore, ſaith the Wiſe man, of running into exceſs (of which thou art in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:99434:206"/> great danger at a great Table, if thou haſt a great ſtomach) as if the knife wherewith thou cutteſt thy meat, would certainly cut thy throat, if thou eateſt too much. In ſhort, he adviſes a man to affright himſelf from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance; where is a great temptation to it.</p>
                  <p>There are thoſe indeed that take the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>ve,</hi> in the beginning of the verſe, to ſignifie as much as

                  <p>[c] After this follows an Admonition againſt
<hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> v. 4. where he neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all labour, nor a provident care (which in other places he commends) but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents how vain it is, to be over-ſolicitous; and to leave no thoughts, nor ſtrength for any thing elſe: for ſo the firſt word is, do not <hi>weary thy ſelf</hi> to be rich. And in the next part of the Sentence, he onely bids us
<hi>deſiſt from</hi> our own underſtanding; meaning thereby, either we ſhould not wholly truſt to that, though in the uſe of honeſt means; or that we ſhould not follow our own inventions, contrary to the divine direction. Some would have the meaning of the whole to be this; do not prefer the getting of riches, before the getting of wiſedom: taking the verſe as
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99434:206"/> if it ran thus, <hi>labour not for riches ſo as to ceaſe from the proſecution of wiſedom:</hi> let not thy worldly cares hinder better things, and then there is no danger: which is an excellent ſenſe, if the words would bear it.</p>
                  <p>[d] The reaſon which <hi>Solomon</hi> adds <hi>v.</hi> 5. hath little or no difficulty in it; which is from the uncertainty, either of getting or of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Riches. Whoſe inconſtancy he ſets forth by the flight of an <hi>Eagle:</hi> which of all other birds is obſerved to fly
<hi>ſwifteſt,</hi> and <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> into heaven (as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks) or into the clouds (as other Authours) that is, quite out of ſight. Whence it is that God ſaying, he carried the Iſraelites out of

Not conſidering, what lies open and obvious to every bodies eyes, that there is not hurt in the thing it ſelf (which is a ſingular divine benefit) but in our exceſs. Whereby innumerable diſeaſes are bred in the body, the reaſon for the preſent ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the moſt abſurd affections ſtirred up: which change men for the time into beaſts.

                  <p>[a] The proneneſs of good men, eſpecially while they are weak, and onely in the beginnings of Goodneſs, to be dejected at the proſperity of the ungodly, and ſo to be tempted to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, is the reaſon, that the admonition we meet withall in the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe is ſo often repeated. Which we find before III. 31. XXIII. 17. and comes again <hi>v.</hi> 18. of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>[b] And, in like manner, for the incouragement of well-diſpoſed perſons, to depend on God's bleſſing, in the exerciſe of a vertuous pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for the getting, increaſing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of an eſtate (<hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5.) he repeats another obſervation (<hi>v.</hi>
6, 7.) of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which Wiſedom hath over mere ſtrength: which we had ſeveral times before, XI. 14. XV. 22. XX. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:99434:216"/> [c] And then having ſhown that it is not Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to invent new ways of doing hurt (<hi>v.</hi> 8, 9,) he adviſes to diligence in the acquiring of true Wiſedom, while we are in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For elſe we ſhall not be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our ſelves when Adverſity comes. So ſome underſtand <hi>v.</hi> 10. which we tranſlate otherways, and ſo do moſt Interpreters: and therefore I have expreſſed, the ſenſe of our tranſlation firſt; and onely annexed the other to it. There is a third, which I have taken no notice of in my Paraphraſe, becauſe it doth not ſeem to me to be genuine; which is this,
<hi>If adverſity deject thee, and break thy ſpirit; thou wilt be ſo much the more unable to get out of it.</hi> But it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent obſervation, and therefore I thought good here to mention it: though the ſimpleſt ſenſe ſeems to be that which we follow, and in brief is this; <hi>Thou art not a man of courage, if thou canſt not bear adverſity with an equal mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[d] And there is a courage to be exerciſed in our charitable ſuccouring of others, as well as in our own diſtreſſes; which he commends in the following words, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. Where he preſſes with a great deal of warmth (as will appear to thoſe that underſtand the Hebrew language, and reade the laſt words with an interrogation) the neceſſity of giving our aſſiſtance for the reſcuing of innocent perſons (when their lives are in danger) either by
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99434:216"/> counſelling them, or petitioning others on their behalf, or purchaſing their releaſe with money, or uſing our authority, or power (if we have any and can do it lawfully) for their deliverance. For this chiefly belongs to Magiſtrates, and thoſe that are in publick Office; who ought not to be over-awed by great men, from undertaking the protection and relief of thoſe who are unjuſtly oppreſſed. This I think <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath expreſſed, as well, or better than any I have met withall, in this manner:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"God commands both the Magiſtrate and private men, not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the innocent, and likewiſe not to aſſiſt unjuſt cruelty. But quite contrary the Magiſtrate ought to be the Guardian of innocent mens lives; and private perſons in their places ought to oppoſe, without ſedition, unjuſt ſeverity, as much as they are able. There are many examples of this in the Scripture. <hi>Jonathan</hi> oppoſed his Father, and helpt to preſerve <hi>David;</hi> not onely by the good teſtimony he gave of him, but by other good offices. <hi>Obadiah</hi> fed the Prophets, whom <hi>Jezabel</hi> deſigned to have killed. The
<hi>Eunuch</hi> pulled up <hi>Jeremiah</hi> out of the dungeon; and the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwifes ſaved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> children, as
<hi>Rahab</hi> afterward did the ſpies. In the time of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> a noble perſon in the city of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly tore down the Edict of the Emperour,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:99434:217"/> for putting Chriſtians to death; that he might ſhow he deteſted that unjuſt cruelty. Examples to the contrary, are ſuch as that of <hi>Doeg,</hi> who in compliance with
<hi>Saul</hi>'s fury ſlew the innocent Prieſts: and many now, either openly or by their ſilence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the unjuſt ſeverity, which is exerciſed againſt our Churches. Let ſuch think of theſe words of <hi>Solomon, If thou forbear to deliver them.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] Who ſhows with what pleaſure ſuch Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be received, and how profitable, nay neceſſary, they are, by the example of <hi>Honey</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.) which was not onely reckoned the ſweeteſt thing in thoſe Countries (as appears by many places of Scripture) but one of thoſe, which was moſt neceſſary, for humane life; as appears by the words of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> XXXIX. 41. For it was uſefull for food, for drink, for medicine, for preſerving of dead bodies; and was ſo natural to them, that it ſeems to have been the food of Infants, VII. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15. Whence the ancient Chriſtians, were wont to give a little <hi>milk and honey</hi> to thoſe who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; as perſons newly regenerate and born again: becauſe <hi>Honey</hi> as well as
<hi>Milk,</hi> was the nutriment of little children in thoſe days and countries. How refreſhing it was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſtory of
<hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIV. 17. and in what common uſe, by the example of our Saviour after his Reſurrection, XXIV.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:99434:217"/> 
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 41, 42. Which may all be applied to Wiſedom; from whence the mind derives the greateſt ſatisfaction: and therefore ought to be, as it were, our daily diet (without which we cannot ſubſiſt) from the beginning of our days, unto the end of them.</p>
                  <p>[f] For many gracious promiſes are made to it, which muſt not be ſo underſtood, he ſhows, as if no evil thing ſhould befall good men: but as Wiſedom teaches them to be content with a little (which ſeems to be denoted by the word we tranſlate <hi>habitation,</hi> v. 15.) ſo when they meet with any affliction, it inſtructs them not to deſpair of better days. So thoſe words are to be underſtood <hi>v.</hi> 16. Which are commonly not onely in <hi>Sermons,</hi> but in <hi>Books</hi> alſo applied to falling into ſin: And that men may the more ſecurely indulge themſelves in their ſins, and yet think themſelves good men, they have very cunningly added ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them. For they are commonly cited thus, <hi>A juſt man falleth ſeven times a day.</hi> Which laſt words [<hi>a day,</hi> or <hi>in a day</hi>] are not in any tranſlation of the Bible (much leſs in the Original) but onely ſome corrupt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Vulgar Latin:</hi> which againſt the plain ſcope of the Context, and the meaning of the words, ſeems to underſtand this place of falling into ſin. When the word
<hi>fall</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſignifies ſo; but always <hi>trouble</hi> and
<hi>cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:</hi> as abundance of learned men have long ago obſerved; particularly <hi>Tarnovius;</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:99434:218"/> and ſince him, <hi>Amama,</hi> and
<hi>Grotius.</hi> Nor needs there any other proof of it, than thoſe places (which are many) wherein <hi>falling</hi> and <hi>riſing again</hi> being oppoſed; both of them have reſpect to <hi>calamities:</hi> and the former ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>being plunged into them,</hi> and the other, <hi>getting out of them.</hi> And ſo, in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue adverſities, are called
<hi>caſus, falls,</hi> as every body knows.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we muſt make uſe of other places, for the confuting the fancy of perfection in this life; and for the comfort of thoſe, who are caſt down by their lapſes into ſin: And take heed of reading the holy Scriptures ſo careleſly, as to turn our Medicine into poyſon: which is the fault of thoſe, who from ſuch miſtakes, give way to their evil affections; and let them carry them into ſin.</p>
                  <p>[g] Againſt this there follows a ſevere caution, in the Wiſe man, who would not have us ſo much as indulge our ſelves in that pleaſure, we are apt to take, in ſeeing our Enemies fall into ſuch troubles, as they have given us <hi>v.</hi> 17. And to this he annexes another which cannot be too often repeated (<hi>v.</hi> 19.) againſt fretting at the proſperity of thoſe who doe ill: which he often prohibits; but doth it now in the words of his Father <hi>David,</hi> XXXVII. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. whoſe authority was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held very great in that Church: and who had made many obſervations, from his own experience, of the ſhortneſs of their felicity;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99434:218"/> and the ſudden changes, with which they were often ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed.</p>
                  <p>[h] An inſtance he gives of this in the next precept (<hi>v.</hi> 21, 22.) which, ſaith <hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> (ſo carefull were the Reformers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi>) is to be reckoned among the principal ſentences, that are to be obſerved in this Book: comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience, and directing the order of it.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"For firſt he commands us to obey God; and then the King: whoſe office it is to ſee the Laws of God obſerved by his Subjects; and to make ſuch Laws as are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to God's Laws; and to puniſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious; and to pronounce all ſentences according to the Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>in dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous caſes, their decrees ought to prevail;</hi> not onely becauſe there is a probable reaſon on their ſide, but becauſe of the Authority given from above unto Magiſtrates: whom God would have us in civil affairs, though dubious before, to obey. And becauſe God gives us ſometimes more mild and gentle, ſometimes leſs kind. He would have us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to bear <hi>onera duriora,</hi> if they be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and obedience be not a ſin. For he threatens here a ſevere vengeance to thoſe that are <hi>ſeditious:</hi> ſo he tranſlates the word <hi>Schonim;</hi> which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>fools</hi> (<hi>changelings</hi> in our language) for they are no better, who invert and <hi>change</hi> this order (as ſome underſtand the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99434:219"/> word) <hi>either by advancing the will of the Prince above all Law, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what God himſelf hath enacted; or by pretending Religion and the fear of the Lord, for rebellion againſt the King, who ordains nothing againſt God's Law.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[i] But there is no neceſſity of gloſſing upon that word (which we render <hi>given to change</hi>) for though it be diverſly tranſlated, the ſenſe is ſtill the ſame. And ſome of the varieties that are of opinions, about the ſenſe of the latter part of the 22 verſe, I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe, and made them agree well enough.
<hi>Lud de Dieu</hi> is alone by himſelf (as far as I can find) who would have that word we render <hi>both of them,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>their years:</hi> and the meaning to be; <hi>who knows how ſoon their life may be at a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable end?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the following ſentences, which are rules alſo of Wiſedom, there is no difficulty; but a little in <hi>v.</hi> 26. and 28. Where I have indeavoured to comprehend ſeveral expoſitions; and connext them together in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe: but think not fit to enlarge this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face any further, by giving a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them.</p>

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>[a] Here begins the THIRD PART of the Book of Proverbs; which are a Collection made by ſome belonging to <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> and acknowledged here (in the entrance of the Book) as well as the former, to be
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s. Who ſpake a great many <hi>Proverbs</hi> (we reade 1
<hi>King.</hi> IV. 32.) which no doubt were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his Succeſſours in a Book; if he did not ſet them down there himſelf. Out of which Volume, ſome good men had ſelected ſuch as they thought moſt uſefull for the people: and beſides thoſe in the foregoing Chapters, which had been compiled, either in his own days, or ſoon after; theſe alſo
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99434:226"/> which follow, were thought good to be added in the days of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Who reſtoring the ſervice of God in the <hi>Temple</hi> to its purity and ſplendour (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 3,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> XXX. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> XXXI. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) took care in all likelyhood for the better inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people in piety, to revive the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi> alſo: and to preſs
<hi>them</hi> (as he had done the <hi>Prieſts</hi>) to doe their duty faithfully; in teaching the Laws of God, and informing the people in all things that might be profitable for them.</p>
                  <p>Out of which Schools ſome were choſen, it is probable, to attend the King himſelf; who are called his <hi>men</hi> or
<hi>ſervants:</hi> who out of their great zeal to promote uſefull learning, culled out more <hi>Proverbs</hi> from among that great heap of <hi>three thouſand</hi> (which would have been too great a bulk to have been all publiſhed, and perhaps all of them not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manners, or good government) and ſuch eſpecially as they ſaw would doe good to the
<hi>Prince</hi> as well as to the people: of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are thoſe that are put into this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; many of which belong to the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the publick affairs. I am not able to produce expreſs authority for all this; but I think it may be fairly conjectured from thoſe words, 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> XXXI. <hi>ult.</hi> where we reade of the pains
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> took, about the <hi>Law,</hi> and about the
<hi>Commandments;</hi> as well as about the <hi>ſervice of the houſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:99434:227"/> But who the perſons were, that he employed in tranſcribing theſe <hi>Proverbs</hi> out of the ancient Records, is more obſcure. Some of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ſay, <hi>Shebna</hi> the Scribe, and his <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> or <hi>Clerks</hi> that were under the principal <hi>Secretary.</hi> Others add <hi>Eliakim</hi> and <hi>Joah</hi> (who are joyned together with him in 2 <hi>King.</hi> XVIII. 26, 37.) Others fancy them to have been <hi>Eſaiah</hi> (a perſon of great quality, near of kin to the King, and very familiar with him) together with <hi>Hoſeah</hi> and <hi>Micah;</hi> who all lived in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and might poſſibly undertake this excellent Work. In which they inſert ſome things, which are to be found, in the foregoing parts of this Book, in words but little different, as <hi>v.</hi> 24. of this Chapter, and <hi>Ch.</hi> XXVI. 13, 15, 22. and other places; of which I cannot ſtay here to give an account.</p>
                  <p>[b] They begin the Book with a Sentence, which the Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> applies to all the learning and wiſedom of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In which, ſaith he,
<hi>Solomon</hi> challenges nothing to himſelf, but onely the honour of the inquiſition, and invention of Truth: <hi>which it is the glory of God to conceal, and the glory of a King to find out.</hi> As if the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty took delight to hide his works, to the end to have them found out; and as if Kings could not attain a greater honour (or pleaſure or recreation either) than to employ themſelves in that buſineſs: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99434:227"/> the great command they have of wits, and means; whereby the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things may be effected."</q> Thus he L. VI. of the <hi>Advanc. of Learn.</hi> Ch. 6.</p>
                  <p>Which is a very ingenious gloſs; if we refer both parts of the Sentence to one and the ſame <hi>matter:</hi> tacitely admoniſhing
<hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and in him all ſucceeding Kings, not to ſpend their time in any thing ſo much; as in ſearching after truth; and indeavouring to underſtand not onely the ſecrets of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of the Laws of God, and of all his Works: that they may not be impoſed upon by falſe colours and deceitfull gloſſes; which cunning wits are apt to put upon cauſes that are brought before them; nay, upon the Book of God it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But if the words be well examined, they will be found to ſpeak rather of different <hi>matters;</hi> which God conceals, and into which Kings penetrate. By which ſome underſtand one thing, and ſome another: but taking the word <hi>Elohim</hi> to relate to God's Government of the World; that which I have ſaid in the Paraphraſe, ſeems to me neareſt to the buſineſs. And <hi>Janſenius</hi> his expoſition is not forced; who diſcourſes to this purpoſe. It is part of God's glory that he need ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing; becauſe He perfectly knows all things: and yet need not declare that He takes notice of every thing (becauſe he can doe it when he pleaſes) but rather ſeem to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:99434:228"/> diſſemble his knowledge; in which he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully declares his patience and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring towards us. But Kings on Earth muſt not herein imitate Him; for it is their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſearch diligently and enquire into the ſtate of their Kingdom; and to correct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently what they find amiſs; leſt it be out of their power, when it is ſtrengthened by long cuſtom and numerous offenders. But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in difficult and intricate buſineſſes, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with darkneſs and obſcurity, perplexed with many windings and turnings, and with crafty and ſubtil conveyances; there to ſpy light, and by wiſedom and diligence to rip up a foul matter, and ſearching the cauſe to the bottom to make a diſcovery of all, is a thing moſt worthy of a King, and tends high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his honour. In ſhort, <hi>as it makes for the glory of God, that he need enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing; but, when he knows all things, yet conceals that knowledge: ſo, on the contrary ſide, it makes for the glory of Kings, that when they are forced to confeſs, that they are ignorant, as well as other men, of many things; they make ſuch diligent enquiry, that they diſcover and detect thoſe things, which others have intangled, and would have buried in darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſome ſuch purpoſe, all Interpreters expound theſe words, ſave one: who refers both part of the Sentence to Kings (underſtanding by <hi>Elohim, Gods,</hi> Judges and Princes) in this
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:99434:228"/> ſenſe; <hi>wiſe Kings preſerve the reverence which is due to their perſons and place, by concealing carefully their own intentions and counſels; and by finding out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of other men.</hi> Thus <hi>Maldonate;</hi> which I mention, becauſe it is a great truth, though not the ſenſe of the words; but rather the meaning of the following verſe, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>[c] Which concerns Kings alſo, as ſome of thoſe that come after likewiſe do (which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline one to think this Part of the Book of Proverbs, was particularly collected for the uſe of
<hi>Hezekiah</hi>) and hath received this gloſs from the ſame great man I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Lord <hi>Bacon:</hi> who gives this as one of the chief reaſons, why the <hi>hearts of Kings are inſcrutable,</hi> becauſe,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"they being at the very top of humane deſires, have not, for the moſt part, any particular ends propoſed to themſelves (none at leaſt to which they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently and conſtantly aſpire) by the ſite and diſtance of which ends, we may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to take the meaſure and ſcale of the reſt of their actions: whereas there is no private perſon, who is not altogether like a Traveller, that goes intently aiming at ſome certain terms of his journey, where he may ſtay and reſt: from whence one may probably conjecture, what he will doe, or not doe. For if any thing conduce to the end at which he aims, it is likely he will doe it; but if it croſs his deſign, he will
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99434:229"/> not. Therefore he paſſes this judicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, upon the whole: that <hi>Princes are beſt interpreted by their natures, and private perſons by their ends.</hi>" Adv. of Learn. <hi>B. VIII. Ch.</hi> 2.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But from hence alſo he obſerves (in his <hi>firſt</hi> Book) that it is beſt not to be too inquiſitive to penetrate into the hearts of Kings: ſince we are ſo ignorant of the things we ſee with our eyes every day: which the cuſtom of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> aims at, that makes it an heinous offence to gaze and fix their eyes upon Princes: <hi>which is barbarous in the outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but good in the moral:</hi> For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not Subjects to pry too far into their Princes counſels. But it may as well check the ambition, as the curioſity of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; becauſe they can hardly be ſure of that favour, which they may imagin their Prince hath for them: there being ſuch depths in their inclinations and affections as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſound.</p>
                  <p>But in the next verſes Princes are admoniſhed that there is no policy like true Vertue, to ſupport their Thrones: and that in order to it they ſhould not keep ſo much as one ill man about them: who oft-times corrupts the whole Court, and diſturbs the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>[d] And in the next verſe he admoniſhes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not to be vainly ambitious; nor bold and forward to thruſt themſelves into Offices, or into a rank that doth not belong to them:
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:99434:229"/> but to be modeſt, eſpecially in the Prince's preſence; and (according to our Saviour's rule) to be invited to honour, rather than greedily ſeek it. And withall he ſecretly commends to Kings, the care of keeping up their ſtate and dignity: not ſuffering every body to intrude into their preſence, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a check to proud, bold and ſawcy perſons.</p>
                  <p>Then follow private inſtructions, not to be too forward to go to Law; and when we do, to manage Suits fairly, without aſperſing thoſe with whom we contend; and without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Laws of Friendſhip: which require us, not to diſcover the ſecrets wherewith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath intruſted us, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>[e] In the <hi>eleventh</hi> verſe I have followed
<hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi> his interpretation of the word <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skijoth;</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>More Nevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim.</hi> And it being doubtfull, whether by
<hi>apples of gold,</hi> he mean, apples that look like gold, or apples made of gold; I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both.</p>
                  <p>[f] But I muſt not give a particular account of every verſe; and therefore I ſhall onely add, that I have taken the meaning of the 16. and 17. verſes to be, that <hi>moderation is good in all things, eſpecially in thoſe that pleaſe us:</hi> As <hi>honey</hi> doth; which was ſo plentifull in thoſe Countries (as it is in many other) that it was ordinarily found in the <hi>woods,</hi> and <hi>holes of rocks,</hi> &amp;c. as may be ſeen in <hi>Bochart.</hi> L. IV. C. 12. P. 11. <hi>De Sac. Animal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:99434:230"/> [g] In the 20th verſe I have followed
<hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> in what he obſerves out of <hi>Pliny</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>nitre</hi> (whoſe nature is not now well known) that it is exaſperated by <hi>vinegar</hi> or <hi>lime.</hi> But in the latter end of the verſe, I have kept to our Tranſlation, which by <hi>leb ra</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands an heart ill affected by grief or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: which he takes literally for an evil or wicked heart. And makes this the meaning (which ſome others have followed) that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious ſinners, are made more furious by admonitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all ancient Tranſlations there follows after this verſe, this Sentence. <hi>As a moth in a garment or a worm in wood; ſo is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart of man.</hi> But S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the latter end of his Commentaries upon <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> tells us that it was <hi>ſub obelo</hi> in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>'s Works, where he noted all ſuperfluous additions, with that mark.</p>
                  <p>[h] I muſt not omit neither, that the 23d verſe, will admit of a quite contrary ſenſe, to that in our Tranſlation; and is by ſome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thus; <hi>As the north wind begetteth rain</hi> (for ſo it doth in ſome Climates) <hi>ſo a backbiting tongue raiſeth up anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation</hi> (which appear in the countenance, both of him that believes the calumny, and of him that is calumniated; when be knows how he is abuſed.)</p>
                  <p>[i] There is no great difficulty in <hi>v.</hi> 26. But Interpreters are divided about this, whether
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:99434:230"/> he ſpeak of a juſt man's falling into <hi>ſin;</hi> or into ſome <hi>calamity. Melancthon</hi> underſtands the latter, and makes this the ſenſe, that <hi>even wiſe mens minds are extremely troubled, when they ſee the wicked prevail againſt the vertuous:</hi> of which he gives a great many examples. But I have taken in both; and have referred it alſo to all manner of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and not reſtrained it to publick inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> doth; who hath this excellent obſervation upon the place (Book VIII. Ch. 2. Parab. 25.) This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable teaches us, that <hi>States and Republicks muſt above all things beware of an unjuſt and infamous Sentence, in any cauſe of great importance; eſpecially where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent is not abſolved, but he that is not guilty condemned. For injuries ravaging among private perſons do indeed trouble and pollute the ſtreams of Juſtice, yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as in the ſmaller rivulets: but ſuch unjuſt judgments, as I mentioned, from which examples are derived, infect and diſtain the very fountain of Juſtice. For when the Courts of Juſtice ſide with Injuſtice, the ſtate of things is turned, as into a publick Robbery;</hi> &amp; Homo homini fit lupus, <hi>and one Man preys upon another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[k] With this verſe, <hi>de Dieu</hi> connects the next
<hi>v.</hi> 27. and gives the eaſieſt account that I find any where, of the Hebrew Text: onely tranſlating that particle, <hi>but;</hi> which we
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99434:231"/> tranſlate <hi>ſo;</hi> as it is often taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And his ſenſe is this;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Though the juſt may be trampled under foot for a while by the wicked, yet their glory ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: but remain ſo freſh and ſweet, that it ſhall be a glorious thing to enquire into their glorious actions."</q> So he would have the verſe tranſlated thus, <hi>to eat much honey indeed is not good; but to ſearch out their glory</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of juſt men) <hi>is glory.</hi> And if we take the verſe by it ſelf, then the ſenſe may be this, as the
<hi>Belgick</hi> Interpreters tranſlate it (of whom, he, if I miſtake not, was one) <hi>to eat much honey is not good: but to ſearch into excellent things is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; and we cannot therein eaſily offend by exceſs:</hi> which is quite contrary to the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> whoſe ſenſe and meaning (though not the words) may be defended, even without repeating the word <hi>not,</hi> as we do in our Tranſlation: in this manner.
<hi>As honey, though pleaſant to the taſte, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſtomach, if it be immoderately uſed: ſo upon a curious ſearch into things ſublime and glorious (though they be moſt ſweet and deſirable to our underſtanding) we ſhall find our ſelves overwhelmed with a greater glory than we can bear.</hi> And ſo the latter part of the verſe, ſhould word for word be thus tranſlated: <hi>The ſearch of their glory</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of things as ſweet as honey, but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending our knowledge) <hi>is glory:</hi> viz. too bright for our weak minds.</p>

It is as improper to ſing pleaſant ſongs to a man full of grief, as to take away his garment from him in ſharp weather, or to pour vinegar upon nitre: for as the one increaſeth his ſenſe of cold, and the other irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the nitre: ſo ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable mirth makes a ſad man's heart, far more heavy and ſorrowfull than it was before.

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>[a] This Chapter begins with a tacit Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Kings (for whoſe uſe principally this <hi>laſt Part</hi> of the Book of Proverbs was collected, as I noted in the beginning of the foregoing Chapter) to be very carefull in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing preferments onely to worthy perſons. For bad men are made worſe by them; and they doe as much hurt to others, by the abuſe of their power to the diſcouraging of vertue,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:99434:237"/> and promoting vice, as ſnow or hail doth to the fruits of the earth, when they are ripe and ready to be gathered. So that we may make this Aphoriſm out of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words, that
<hi>the blending of ſummer and winter, would not cauſe a greater diſorder in the natural world, than the diſpoſal of honour to bad men (and conſequently throwing contempt upon the good) doth in the world moral:</hi> where wicked men when they are in power, if they can doe no more, will at leaſt pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi>'s againſt thoſe that do not deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>[b] So the Hebrews underſtand the next verſe; which I have extended further: and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated alſo thoſe two words <hi>zippor</hi> and <hi>deror,</hi> a <hi>ſparrow</hi> and a <hi>wild pigeon</hi> (ſee LXXXIV. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.) For <hi>deror</hi> ſignifying here a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bird; in all likelihood <hi>zippor</hi> doth ſo too: and then all agree it ſignifies a <hi>ſparrow,</hi> as the other (<hi>Bochart.</hi> hath proved) doth (not a <hi>ſwallow</hi> but) a <hi>ring-dove,</hi> or <hi>turtle,</hi> or ſome of that kind; which are famous for ſwiftneſs and ſtrength of flight. And the meaning of this verſe is, that <hi>curſes which fly out of mens mouths cauſeleſly, ſhall no more alight where they would have them; than a ſparrow which wanders uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or a dove that flies away ſwiftly, will ſettle according to their direction:</hi> or thus, <hi>ſuch curſes fly as ſwiftly as thoſe birds (whoſe property it is to wander and fly up
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:99434:238"/> and down) over the head of him againſt whom they are directed; and never touch him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancthon</hi> by <hi>curſes</hi> in this place underſtands <hi>calumnies;</hi> of which the world is too full: which ſhall not reſt upon a good man long, before they be confuted. But he himſelf is forced to confeſs that ſometimes they doe great miſchief firſt; and inſtances in <hi>Joſeph, Palamedes, Ariſtides, Theamenes</hi> and
<hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> who loſt his life by this means. After which, he obſerves, the Tragedy of <hi>Palame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> being acted (in which the Poet bewailed the death of the beſt of the Greeks, who ſung like a ſweet nightingale, but hurt no man) the Citizens expelled the accuſers of
<hi>Socrates</hi> out of <hi>Athens.</hi> But this doth not ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Hebrew word; which ſignifies ſuch evil ſpeaking, as amounts to a
<hi>curſe:</hi> which the Wiſe man ſaith ſhall not reſt upon a man when it is cauſeleſs, but fly away like a bird that ſettles no where till it comes to its proper place: <hi>As the curſe returns many times, and ſettles upon him that made it, when it lights not on him that was curſed:</hi> which ſenſe, one reading of the Hebrew words expreſſes plainly enough: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have not omitted it.</p>
                  <p>[c] After which obſervations, there follows another to ſhew, that a leud fool ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſent to a houſe in correction, than have any preferment, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Nothing leſs
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:99434:238"/> will cure him, as it follows <hi>v.</hi>
4, 5. where he admoniſhes us, how vain it is to hold any diſcourſe with him; any further than merely to ſhew that he is a fool; and if it be poſſible to confute (not what he ſays but) the vain opinion he hath conceived of himſelf. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath given a good account of theſe two verſes, in the beginning of his Letter to <hi>Demetrian:</hi> who having babled a long time againſt Chriſtianity, like a mad man, with loud clamours onely and no ſenſe, the good Father thought fit to anſwer him with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and overcome rage with patience; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to no more purpoſe to go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an irreligious man with Religion, or reſtrain a mad man with meekneſs, than to offer light to the blind, or ſpeak to the deaf, or reaſon with a brute. But when <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> at laſt offered ſomething that lookt like an Argument, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not any longer keep ſilence; leſt his modeſty ſhould be thought diſtruſt of his cauſe; and whilſt he diſdained to refute falſe criminations, he ſhould ſeem to acknowledge the crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancthon</hi> wholly refers both verſes to reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and calumnies: which he ſhews it is fit, either utterly to neglect; or to confute in a few words.</p>
                  <p>[d] Then the Wiſe man proceeds to ſhew, that ſuch a fool is very unfit to be ſo much as ſent on a meſſage: which he will neither deliver right, nor return a good anſwer. The firſt
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:99434:239"/> ſeems to be expreſſed by
<hi>cutting off the legs;</hi> as much as to ſay, a buſineſs committed to ſuch a perſon, will no more proceed, than a man can go without legs: the latter by <hi>drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in injury;</hi> as much as to ſay, inſtead of having ſatisfaction in what he deſires, he muſt be content to ſwallow abundance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and ill dealing.</p>
                  <p>[e] After this follow ſeveral other obſervations about Fools; in ſome of which, there are words of no ſmall difficulty: which I cannot here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly explain, as ſome may deſire, becauſe it would take up too much room. But I have expreſſed the ſenſe of them, as well as I could, in the Paraphraſe. As for example, the word <hi>Dalju</hi> v. 7. ſignifying ſomething of <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> or lifting up, I have explained
<hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;</hi> than which nothing is more unſutable to a lame man: as ſpeeches full of reaſon in themſelves, are moſt abſurd, when witleſly applied by a fool.</p>
                  <p>[f] And the word <hi>Margoma,</hi> in the 8th verſe, which is very variouſly tranſlated by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, I have expreſſed in two ſenſes of it: but look upon it as ſuperfluous to trouble the Reader with what learned men (ſuch as <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> and <hi>Selden,</hi> &amp;c.) have written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heaps of ſtones in the high-way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which ſuperſtitious people were wont to caſt one as they paſſed by, in honour of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> &amp;c. For I do not think this cuſtom was as old as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time. Nor is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:99434:239"/> to underſtand ſuch a heap of ſtones, as covered the dead bodies of thoſe who were ſtoned to death: but in general any heap of pebles; or elſe a <hi>ſling,</hi> as the
<hi>Chaldee</hi> and the LXX. whom we follow, expound it.</p>
                  <p>[g] And <hi>v.</hi> 10. the firſt word <hi>rab, great,</hi> may be applied either to God, or to a Prince: and that either good or bad. All which I have taken notice of; and expreſſed the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſes wherein the word <hi>cholalti</hi> is uſed. But there is one ſignification more of the word <hi>rab,</hi> which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> generally follow (which I think fit to mention here, becauſe I have not touched on it in the Paraphraſe, and it makes no improper ſenſe of the place) who take it for a <hi>Maſter</hi> in any ſort of Art or Learning; and expound it thus:
<hi>A maſter in his art forms all things excellently well: but he that hires a fool</hi> (or a <hi>bungler,</hi> as we ſpeak) <hi>gives his money to have his work ſpoiled.</hi> Thus <hi>Melancthon;</hi> who takes it to be an Admonition belonging to prudence in the choice of fit perſons for every buſineſs; not believing thoſe that crack and brag what they are able to doe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ex. gr. <hi>plurimi ſunt impoſtores, qui volunt videri medici: plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi indocti concionatores, qui adulantur vulgo aut potentioribus.</hi> And he heaps up many excellent ſayings to this purpoſe, that men <hi>ſhould meddle onely with that which they underſtand:</hi> concluding with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the people, which they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:99434:240"/> remember; <hi>Ignorance makes men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi> And thus <hi>Caſtalio</hi> took the word <hi>rab;</hi> but to this ſenſe, <hi>A wiſe man does his buſineſs himſelf; and not by fools, who marr it all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[h] Among other examples of the Wiſe man's obſervation
<hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Melancthon</hi> mentions this; which is not commonly noted. The <hi>Sodomites</hi> being divinely delivered by the help of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who overthrew the Army that had ſpoiled them, and recovered the ſpoil; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting their former puniſhment and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliverance, ran furiouſly into more foul ſins, wherein they utterly periſhed, by a moſt terrible vengeance.</p>
                  <p>[i] Then follow, after one obſervation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a conceited fellow, ſeveral obſervations about <hi>Sloth:</hi> ſome of which had been noted before in the foregoing parts of this Book, but are here put together by the <hi>men of Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> in ſome order; and with ſome additions. For here ſeem to be <hi>three</hi> degrees of ſloth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. The <hi>firſt,</hi> when a man is loth to ſtir out of doors, about his buſineſs in the field, <hi>v.</hi> 13. the
<hi>ſecond,</hi> when he is loth ſo much as to leave his bed, <hi>v.</hi>
14. and the <hi>third</hi> and higheſt, when he will ſcarce put his hand to his mouth, <hi>v.</hi> 15. by which hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical expreſſion he moſt admirably ſets forth the incredible lazineſs of ſome men; which increaſes upon them continually, if they will not ſhake it off. And yet ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:99434:240"/> (he obſerves <hi>v.</hi> 16.) they are withall, that they laugh at thoſe, who take a great deal of pains to be wiſe: and fancy themſelves much wiſer, becauſe, without any pains, they can find fault ſometime in other mens Works. Nay, this very thing perhaps, they think a piece of folly, to ſtudy hard; imagining it to be the greateſt wiſedom, to enjoy their eaſe and reap the benefit of other mens labours.</p>
                  <p>After which follows an Admonition againſt raſh intermeddling in other mens affairs; againſt backbiters, and diſſemblers; eſpecially ſuch as are malicious; and cover the malignity of their minds, under fair ſhews of love, or perhaps of Friendſhip. In ſeveral of which verſes the words are capable of more ſenſes than one; which I have endeavoured to knit together in the Paraphraſe. An example of which I might give particularly, in <hi>v.</hi> 24. where the word <hi>jinnaker</hi> may be rendred ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he pretends to be what he is not,</hi> or <hi>he is known to be what he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[k] And what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays in the next verſe concerning him that <hi>flattereth</hi> another, ſome extend to all wicked men; none of which are to be truſted: but, as one of our own Writers adviſes, <hi>though a wicked man have done thee ſeven courteſies, and promiſe fair for the eighth; yet do not truſt him: for there are ſeven abominations in his heart. And though thou mayſt think thou haſt ſome hank upon him, do not depend upon it;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:99434:241"/> for he can unfetter himſelf from them all, as</hi> Samſon <hi>from the green withs and cords, wherewith the Philiſtins bound him, unleſs God mightily reſtrain him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[l] But I onely obſerve one thing more; that the laſt verſe is capable of this ſenſe; which I have in part touched: <hi>A Lyar is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be a Friend; for if he be reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, truth makes him hate the perſon that detects his falſhood: if he be not reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, his fulſome flatteries will alienate from him, the mind of his Friend.</hi>

                  <p>[a] This Chapter begins with a moſt uſefull Admonition, of the inconſtancy and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things here below: like to which there are a great many in other Authours, which ſeveral Writers have collected (but I ſhall not trouble the Readers withall) parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Melancthon:</hi> who obſerves that the Wiſe man here teaches us
<hi>modeſty;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibites theſe <hi>two</hi> great vices:
<hi>confidence in our ſelves,</hi> or any thing we have; and <hi>raſh undertaking unneceſſary things,</hi> out of a fooliſh hope they will ſucceed according to our deſires. <hi>Wiſe and good men ſhould one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meddle within the bounds of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and depend alſo on God for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:</hi> but not attempt things without juſt cauſe, preſuming they can carry them as they pleaſe. Thus <hi>Pericles,</hi> ſays he, made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary War, for a ſlight reaſon; which many then judged ought to have been neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in like manner paſſed over into <hi>Sicily:</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> made War upon the <hi>Romans:</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> would needs try his fortune (as they called it) in War, when he might have kept peace, upon honeſt conditions. All theſe were deſtructive to
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:99434:247"/> their Countries, and the
<hi>Proverb</hi> was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>[b] And there is nothing more fooliſh than the vanity of praiſing themſelves; which follows in the next verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) and is noted by all Authours; who have many ſharp ſayings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, which I alſo paſs over. But ſhall take notice (becauſe it is ſtill more uſefull) what the ſame good man <hi>Melancthon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon the
<hi>third</hi> verſe; that <hi>fools and unskilfull people are more apt to be angry than others:</hi> becauſe they conſider not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of mankind, and that there are many errours of others which ought to be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and cured after a gentle manner: whence that true ſaying
<hi>Imperito nunquam quicquam injuſtius eſt.</hi> But as Goodneſs is moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in God; who himſelf bears with many evils in us, and commands us to <hi>forgive and it ſhall be forgiven us:</hi> ſo wiſe men bend their minds to goodneſs and lenity; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the common infirmities of all men, their own as well as others. Nor can there be a more lively picture of the implacable ſpirit of a fool, than that which our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath drawn in the Goſpel; of a cruel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who when he had been forgiven
<hi>ſixty tonne</hi> of Gold by his Maſter, would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his fellow ſervant an <hi>hundred pence, Matth.</hi> XVIII. This Sentence of
<hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:99434:247"/> therefore, ſaith he, admoniſhes us to avoid the company of fools, <hi>qui neque cognoſcere neque ignoſcere norunt;</hi> as well as to be ſo wiſe our ſelves, as to moderate our paſſions, and to be mindfull of humane weakneſs. For <hi>nihil magnum quod non eſt placidum,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks: like unto which he adds other ſayings out of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] In the next verſe but one ſome think the Wiſe man ſpeaks of ſuch Friends as are too tender and delicate; and for fear of offending others, have not the courage to tell them of their errours: whom the great Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> follows; and thinks <hi>Solomon prefers an open Enemy before ſuch a Friend:</hi> which I do not take to be the meaning; but ſhall here ſet down his excellent obſervation upon theſe words (<hi>Adv. of Learn.</hi> Book VIII. Ch. 2. Parab. 29.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Parable, ſaith he, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the ſoft nature of ſuch Friends as will not uſe the privilege which Friendſhip gives them, in admoniſhing their Friends with freedom and confidence, as well of their errours, as of their dangers. <hi>For what ſhall I doe?</hi> ſays ſuch a tender-hearted Friend, <hi>or which way ſhall I turn my ſelf? I love him as dearly as any man can do another: and if any misfortune ſhould befall him, I could willingly pawn my own perſon for his redemption. But I know his diſpoſition; if I deal freely with him, I ſhall offend him; at leaſt make
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:99434:248"/> him ſad: and yet doe him no good. And I ſhall ſooner eſtrange him from my Friendſhip, than reclaim him from thoſe courſes, upon which his mind is reſolved:</hi> Such a Friend as this, <hi>Solomon</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends as weak and worthleſs, and ſays that a man may reap more profit from a manifeſt Enemy, than from ſuch an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Friend. For he may perhaps hear that by way of reproach from an Enemy, which, through too much indulgence, was but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiſpered by a Friend."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[d] And one great reaſon why men are loth to tell others of their faults, is becauſe they are wont to take it heinouſly. If men were more willing to receive reproof, others would more faithfully give it: of which the Wiſe man therefore admoniſhes us, <hi>v.</hi> 6. where the word
<hi>Nataroth</hi> is ſo difficult, that it admits va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious interpretations: ſome of which I have expreſſed in the Paraphraſe. And made <hi>v.</hi>
7. a caution againſt the immoderate enjoyment of pleaſures: which commend themſelves to us, by their rarer uſe. As the next, <hi>v.</hi> 8. is a caution againſt unſettledneſs of mind, and diſcontent with our preſent condition; which, not onely ſpoils all our pleaſures, but, often carries men reſtleſsly to their ruine: where <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſuggeſts this uſefull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, that there is no condition of life, no function, without its cares, troubles and dangers; which makes men ſoon weary of it:
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:99434:248"/> according to the ancient ſaying,
<hi>Optat ephip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia bos piger, optat arare caballus.</hi> But the Wiſe man would have us underſtand, that nothing is more dangerous than this; and therefore to take care leſt, tired and broken with diſguſts, we lightly deſert that kind of life, to which we are rightly called. All the ancient wiſedom hath obſerved, that ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory humours never thrive: about which they have many Proverbs, with which I ſhall not fill theſe Papers.</p>
                  <p>[e] After this follow ſome advices about Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and other things; which have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, in the foregoing parts of this Book. And then he ſeems, <hi>v.</hi> 14. to lay open the guiſe of Flatterers, who hope to curry favour with their Benefactours, by extolling their bounty with extravagant praiſes. So I have expounded that verſe, not merely of thoſe that praiſe others, but praiſe them for their kindneſs to themſelves: as the word <hi>Barak</hi> properly imports. The intention of which is onely to get ſtill more from them: which is commonly the end of all thoſe, that praiſe others immoderately, for their rare qualities and perfections; hoping thereby to make them extraordinary kind to them, above all other men. Thus the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath obſerved about this matter: whoſe gloſs upon theſe words is this (in the forenamed place,
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> 33.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Moderate and ſeaſonable prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, uttered upon occaſion, conduce both to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:99434:249"/> mens fame and fortune; but immoderate, ſtreperous and unſeaſonably poured out, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing: nay, rather, according to the ſenſe of this Parable, they doe much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. For,
<hi>firſt,</hi> they manifeſtly betray themſelves, either to proceed
<hi>from too much affection,</hi> or from <hi>ſtudious affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> whereby they may rather ingratiate themſelves with him whom they praiſe by falſe commendations; than adorn his perſon by juſt and deſerved attributes: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> ſparing and modeſt praiſes commonly invite ſuch as are preſent <hi>to add ſomething of their own to the commendation:</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, profuſe and immodeſt praiſes invite the hearers to <hi>detract and take away ſomething that belongs to them:</hi> thirdly (which is the principal point) <hi>too much magnifying a man ſtirs up envy towards him: ſeeing all immoderate praiſes look a reproach to others, who merit no leſs.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſide this, I cannot quite paſs by the gloſs which ſome have made upon theſe words: who by <hi>jaſchkem babbóker</hi> (which I have applied onely to their too much aſſiduity in praiſing others, as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>from morning to night</hi>) underſtand making too much haſte to praiſe men; when it is, as we ſpeak, but
<hi>early days with them:</hi> and they have made no progreſs in thoſe vertues for which they are commended. And then
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:99434:249"/> the ſenſe is, <hi>there is nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, than to cry up men too ſoon, for their parts or for their vertues; before they be ſufficiently tried, and have made a due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: for this, inſtead of doing them ſervice, proves many times their ruine:</hi> making them, that is, entertain a vain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own worth, and grow idle, or negligent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo dwindle away to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>[f] What he ſaith afterward of <hi>a railing wife, ver.</hi>
16. may be thus expreſſed, in ſhort: <hi>There are three things that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; becauſe they betray themſelves: the wind, a ſtrong perſume, and a ſcolding wife:</hi> with which ſome joyn the next verſe,
<hi>v.</hi> 17. as a remedy for the miſchief of a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wife; and thus render it: <hi>As iron is eaſily joyned with iron; ſo is a man with his equal.</hi> And therefore the beſt way for a man to avoid the trouble of a bad wife, is not to chuſe one for his conſort, becauſe ſhe is rich, or becauſe ſhe is beautifull onely; but becauſe ſhe is like him in humour, and inclination, and condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurine</hi> Verſion. And <hi>de Dieu</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; who makes this Proverb, no more than that of <hi>like to like;</hi> which beſt agree together. But this is too narrow; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have followed ours, and indeed all the ancient Tranſlations: who take this to be of the ſame ſignification with another old ſaying,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:99434:250"/> 
                     <hi>one man is no body:</hi> and therefore God hath formed us to have a communion with each other. The neceſſity of which is expreſſed in abundance of ancient Aphoriſms; which admoniſh us to confer with others, and to hearken to the counſel and judgment of the wiſe. And daily experience ſhews us how dangerous it is

                  <p>[g] The next verſe but one, <hi>v.</hi> 19. is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo variouſly by Interpreters, that it is a labour to number their expoſitions: ſome of which are directly contrary to the other. For according as they take the <hi>face</hi> to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in
<hi>water;</hi> either <hi>perfectly,</hi> or ſo <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricouſly</hi> and
<hi>moveably,</hi> that it is hard to diſcern what ſort of face it is: ſo they make it either <hi>eaſie,</hi> or <hi>impoſſible</hi> to underſtand the hearts of other men. <hi>Melancthon</hi> took it in the latter ſenſe; inculcating the old whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Leſſons,

But now it is generally expounded the other way: and ſome expound it of mens own hearts, and ſome of the hearts of other men. I have in the Paraphraſe expreſſed <hi>two</hi> of thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, which I look't upon as moſt ſimple. And think fit here to mention that of <hi>Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> who applies it to a man's ſelf in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>as a man may know what kind of face he hath, if he will look into the water: ſo he may know what kind of man he is, if he will examin his Conſcience.</hi> And this of <hi>Maldonate</hi> who is alone (as far as I can
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:99434:251"/> find) in his expoſition, which is this, <hi>as a man's face may be ſeen in the water; ſo his heart, or his inward affections, may be ſeen in his Countenance:</hi> taking <hi>man</hi> in the concluſion of the Sentence, for the outward man, <hi>i. e.</hi> his countenance: and making the <hi>Hebrew</hi> run thus, <hi>as a man's face is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that face which appears in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo his heart is anſwerable to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> The Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> as I have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in the beginning of my Paraphraſe on this verſe, takes the end of this Parable to be,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"to diſtinguiſh between the mind of wiſe men, and of thoſe that are not wiſe: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the former to <hi>waters,</hi> or <hi>glaſſes</hi> which receive and repreſent the form and images of things; whereas the other are like to <hi>earth</hi> or
<hi>rude</hi> and <hi>unpoliſhed ſtone,</hi> wherein nothing is reflected. And the mind of a wiſe man (which is ſo capable that it obſerves and comprehends an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of natures and cuſtoms) is the more aptly compared to a <hi>glaſs</hi> or <hi>mirrour;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a glaſs he can ſee his own image, together with the images of other men: which his eyes cannot do alone without the help of a glaſs."</q>

                  <p>And ſo this Parable, it ſeems to me, may not unfitly be expounded after this manner: <hi>A man may ſee himſelf while he looks upon other men; as well as know other men, by conſidering his own inclinations.</hi>

I have expreſſed that which is neareſt to our Tranſlation; and ſeems to be the trueſt touchſtone of this ſort, whereby to try the goodneſs or badneſs of mens minds. Some of which are ſo incorrigible, he ſhews in the next verſe, that the ſoreſt afflictions will not amend them.</p>
                  <p>[i] And then in concluſion he preſſes every one to diligence about his own buſineſs: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially commends the paſtoral care, which men ſhould have about their flocks and their herds: which are the beſt ſort of poſſeſſions, he ſhews, in ſeveral regards.

                  <p>[k] Where he mentions particularly in the laſt verſe, the
<hi>milk of the goats,</hi> and of no other creature: becauſe they had abundance of them, and their milk was in daily uſe; both for meat and for medicine. And for medicine the Ancients preferred it before all other, as moſt moderate, and temperate. So <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aegineta;</hi> the laſt of which writes thus: <hi>Woman's milk is the moſt temperate of all other; next to that goats; and next
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:99434:252"/> to that aſſes; then ſheep; and laſtly cows milk.</hi> From whence it was (<hi>Bochartus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures (who hath heaped up a great deal on this Subject, L.

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>This Chapter conſiſts, as the foregoing did, of ſeveral mixt obſervations: ſome belonging to the concerns of private perſons; others to the publick.</p>
                  <p>[a] It begins with the difference between a good and a bad Conſcience; which diſcovers it ſelf, when there is any danger, of which men are apprehenſive. And in the next verſe, he obſerves the difference between a Nation, when it is bad and when it is good: when its manners are depraved, they fall into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and when they grow better (for moſt Interpreters take the word <hi>Adam</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe
<hi>collectively,</hi> for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people) then they keep their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and live happily. Eſpecially when they have a wiſe and prudent Prince; who is here alſo to be underſtood, in oppoſition to <hi>Many Princes,</hi> either together or ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: by whom a Nation is miſerably haraſſed, when its wickedneſs brings upon it ſuch a puniſhment. So <hi>Melancthon</hi> underſtands <hi>v.</hi> 2.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The complaints, ſaith he, are very uſual concerning the negligence of Princes, their exactions, oppreſſions, want of care to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the people ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:99434:258"/> them and their Court: but God accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both Princes and people; and for the ſins of the people, he gives them ill Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; as <hi>Solomon</hi> here teaches, that for the tranſgreſſion of a country, <hi>i. e.</hi> both of Prince and people,
<hi>many are the Princes thereof:</hi> that is, <hi>none reign long;</hi> or
<hi>many reign together,</hi> oppoſing, and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out, one another. Now for the cure of this he gives a ſingular Admonition, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both for Prince and people, which is this: that <hi>a prudent and wiſe man makes Empire durable.</hi> That is, a wiſe Prince will ſometime depart from his own right to quiet things; and ſuffer ſome inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prevent greater: as <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> did. And on the other ſide, people are to be adviſed, leſt they draw greater miſchiefs upon themſelves by ſeditious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells than thoſe which they ſtudy to remedy."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[b] And there is none greater he ſeems to tell us in the next verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) than when power comes into the hands of a beggarly fellow: who is void of all humanity, and forgets even what he himſelf was, and all the miſeries of poverty; which he perpetuates upon them who are poor already. So <hi>Maldonate</hi> (and he alone I think) expounds that phraſe <hi>veen lechem, and there is no food,</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>before the corn be grown out of the earth:</hi> and by the
<hi>ſweeping rain</hi> underſtands not ſuch rain as beats out the corn when it is in
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:99434:259"/> the ear; but which waſhes away the ſeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſpring up. Even ſo, he that ſpoils the poor, takes away from them, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, what they have not; and extirpates the very ſeed of future riches, which he deprives them of all means of gathering. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which ſubject the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath diſcourſed very ingeniouſly in his VIIIth Book of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning,</hi> Ch. II. Parab. 24.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"This Parable, ſaith he, was by the ancients expreſſed and ſhadowed forth under the fable of <hi>two horſeleeches;</hi> one full, and the other hungry. For oppreſſion coming from the poor and neceſſitous perſon, is far more grievous than that of the rich and the full; becauſe it ſeeks out all tricks for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and leaves no corner unſearch't where money may be found. This kind of oppreſſion was wont alſo to be reſembled to <hi>ſponges;</hi> which being dry ſuck in ſtrongly; but not ſo, being moiſt. And the Parable comprehends in it a profitable inſtruction, both to Princes and to people. To Princes, <hi>that they commit not the government of Provinces or Offices of charge to indigent and indebted perſons:</hi> And to the people, <hi>that they ſuffer not their Kings to ſtruggle with too much want.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But none have gloſſed better upon this place, than an excellent <hi>Prelate</hi> of ours, Biſhop <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in his Sermon upon XXIV. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10, 11. where he diſcourſes to this effect.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That it
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:99434:259"/> is in matter of <hi>power,</hi> as it is in matter of <hi>learning.</hi> They that have but a ſmattering of ſcholarſhip, it is obſerv'd, are the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt to make oſtentation of the few ſcraps they have, for fear there ſhould be no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of their learning, if they ſhould not ſhew it when they can; and yet then they doe it ſo untowardly, that when they think moſt of all to ſhew their ſcholarſhip, they moſt of all, by ſome groſs miſtake or other, betray their ignorance. Even juſt ſo it is in the caſe of power, when men of baſe ſpirits and condition have gotten a little of it into their hands; who conceive their neighbours will not be ſenſible what goodly men they are, if they do not by ſome act or other, ſhew forth their power to the world: But having minds too narrow to comprehend any brave and generous way to doe it; they cannot frame to doe it by any other means, than by trampling upon thoſe that are below them; which they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſon, and without any mercy."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which he illuſtrates very handſomely upon 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> XII. 3.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"If a mean man, ſays he, in any of our Towns or Hamlets, be a little gotten up to overtop moſt of his neighbours in wealth; or be put into ſome ſmall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to deal under ſome great man for the diſpoſing his farms or grounds; or have ſomething to ſell to his neceſſitous neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who muſt buy upon that day; or have

<hi>which ſhould make you not onely to hate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, becauſe it is wicked; but even to ſcorn it, becauſe it is baſe.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] After this, follow ſeveral bad characters of other men: and among the reſt of him that oppreſſes his brother by <hi>uſury</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, v.</hi> 8. where theſe two words, <hi>Neſchech,</hi> and <hi>Tarbith,</hi> do not ſeem to ſignifie, greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and more moderate gain. For all uſury is <hi>Neſchech,</hi> as it reſpects the debtor of whom it is taken; and <hi>Tarbith,</hi> in reſpect of the creditour who is the gainer by it; whether it be great or leſs, that the one gives and the other receives. If there be any other difference between theſe two; it either lies in this, that there were ſeveral ſorts of uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereby men increaſed their eſtates; or the one ſignifies the advantage men made of their money, and the other the advantage
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:99434:260"/> they made of their goods. About which I do not think fit to trouble the Reader any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nor to examin whether their opinion be true, who ſay; <hi>the King was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their unjuſt gain, and give it to better men.</hi> I have left that undetermined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or man ſhould puniſh the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer, but have expreſſed all that the Law forbids in this caſe: which was to take intereſt (as we ſpeak) of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> eſpecially of their <hi>poor</hi> Brethren; which ſome think are onely meant: but I have contented my ſelf to ſay, are
<hi>principally</hi> meant.</p>
                  <p>[d] And in the next verſe but two (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) he obſerves that ſuch men as grow rich, though it be by fraud or oppreſſion, are apt to have a mighty conceit of their own wiſedom: which underſtanding men, though never ſo poor, ſee thorow, and diſcern to be, at beſt, but craft: and many times to be no more than that, which we call
<hi>purſe-pride,</hi> when they have no more wit, but juſt to ſave and hoard up money. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which place ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſecretly intimates <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be an impediment to wiſedom; and poverty a great advantage:</hi> becauſe the one is apt to blow men up into a vain opinion of themſelves; and the other to make them humble and modeſt: the former of which is the greateſt Enemy, and the latter the beſt Friend to Wiſedom. Certain it is, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney having ſo large a command, as to be able
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:99434:261"/> to purchaſe not onely dignity, but great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the multitude; they that have it, are apt to look no further neither for wiſedom nor vertue: which made a confident of
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves) give him this counſel, that if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the decayed ſtate of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, he muſt by all means take away the eſtimation of wealth: for <hi>theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and all other evils, together with the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of money, ſhall ceaſe; if neither publick offices, nor any other dignities, which commonly are coveted, be expoſed to ſale.</hi> And the truth is, ſaith that Lord (<hi>Adv. of Learn.</hi> Book I.) as it was rightly ſaid that <hi>bluſhing is the colour of vertue,</hi> though ſometime it come from vice; ſo we may truly affirm that <hi>poverty is the fortune of vertue,</hi> though ſometime it may proceed from miſgovernment and improvidence. And he adds further, that <hi>the magnificence of Princes and great men, had long ſince tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into barbariſm and rudeneſs; if the poverty of Learning had not kept up civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and decency of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[e] For bad Princes, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews, <hi>v.</hi> 12. bring great contempt and miſery upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as all bad men (<hi>v.</hi>
13, 14.) bring miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon themſelves. But no Princes are more grievous to their Subjects, than ſuch as are needy, and yet have no goodneſs. So I underſtand, with the LXX. verſe 15. where
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:99434:261"/> that word we render <hi>ranging,</hi> is well tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the <hi>Vulgar</hi> an <hi>hungry</hi> bear, as
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> hath ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>[f] Who alſo ſeems to me, to have expreſſed the ſenſe of the next verſe moſt fully; when he obſerves, that according to the manner of the Hebrew Language, there is ſomething wanting in one part of the verſe; which is to be ſupplied out of the other. As when the Pſalmiſt ſaith in LXXXIV. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>one day in thy courts, is better than a thouſand;</hi> he means <hi>elſewhere, out of his courts.</hi> And XCI. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. <hi>a thouſand ſhall fall on thy ſide</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the left hand) <hi>and ten thouſand on thy right hand.</hi> In like manner we are to underſtand this verſe, as if he had ſaid, <hi>A Prince that wants under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and is a great oppreſſour, ſhall ſhorten his days: but he that hates cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs ſhall prolong them.</hi> See Par. I. <hi>de Animal. S.</hi> L. III. C. 25.</p>
                  <p>[g] In the two next verſes I have endeavoured to connect ſeveral Senſes together; as he that examins them will perceive. And in the
21<hi>ſt v.</hi> have taken ſome notice of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s obſervation; that men may be bribed by ſomething elſe beſides money, to pervert juſtice: and more commonly by other reſpects than by that. His words are theſe (B. VIII. <hi>Advanc. of Learn.</hi> Ch. II. Parab. 23.)
<hi>Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humour in a Judge, is more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than the corruption of Bribes. For

                  <p>[a] This Chapter concludes the Collection of Proverbs, made by the <hi>men of Hezekiah;</hi> and contains more advices proper to a Prince (as he was) than any of the reſt: but uſhers them in, with a General admonition, how dangerous it is not to profit by reproofs or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections (ſuch as He and his people had by the hand of <hi>Senacherib</hi>) which when they work upon mens ſpirits there is ſome hope of them: but when they become refractory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible and obſtinately reject them, they are near to a final deſtruction. This wicked tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, he expreſſes by
<hi>hardning the neck:</hi> which is a Metaphor, as <hi>Bochartus</hi> truly obſerves (L. III. <hi>de Sacr. Animal.</hi> C. 41. P. 1.) taken from
<hi>Oxen;</hi> who being put forward draw back and withdraw their necks and ſhoulders from the yoke: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ſo headſtrong and ſtiffnecked, that they cannot be brought to ſubmit to it: unto which the Scripture often alludes, both in the Old Teſtament and the New: for inſtance, XXXII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. VII. <hi>Act.</hi> 51. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belong thoſe expreſſions XLVIII. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. where he ſaith his people had an <hi>iron ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> &amp;c. and that in V. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. where he
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:99434:269"/> ſaith they <hi>had broken the yoke and burſt the bonds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[b] Then follows a tacit Admonition unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to be good, by deſcribing the happineſs which a Nation then enjoys: which they had noted twice before in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and 28. but thought it ſo conſiderable and ſo needfull, that they inſert it here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and the latter part of it once more, <hi>v.</hi> 16. Being a famous obſervation of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David,</hi> XII. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. where he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, <hi>how the wicked flouriſh, and go about confidently into every place, nay, take the liberty to doe as they liſt, when men of no account are exalted to power: who take no care to oppoſe growing wickedneſs, and to keep every man within the bounds of his duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] And after an Admonition (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) that the ſtudy of Wiſedom is the onely preſervative againſt the luſt of uncleanneſs; which, in the preface to this Book it is obſerved, deſtroys abundance of young mea, and their eſtates alſo (for <hi>luſt is very blind, and very prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>) the next obſervation (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Kings again: where <hi>iſh Terumoth,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>a man that receiveth gifts,</hi> is in the Hebrew phraſe <hi>a man of oblations.</hi> For ſo the word <hi>Terumoth</hi> always ſignifies, throughout the whole Bible, <hi>the heave offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> which were offered to God: which would make one think that <hi>iſh Terumoth</hi> (a
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:99434:270"/> man of <hi>heave offerings</hi>) ſignifies here, <hi>a Prince that is ſacrilegious;</hi> and robs the Church of its proper goods: or, if we will not take it in that ſtrict ſenſe, it denotes one that will ſuffer himſelf to be pacified by gifts, and bribed to wink at the moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, which he ought to have ſeverely puniſhed: or, that is ſo unjuſt, as to find fault, perhaps with the moſt innocent perſons, on purpoſe that they may appeaſe him, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him a part of their eſtate to ſave all the reſt: one or other of theſe is the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral expoſition of the words. But I have contented my ſelf with the LXX. (who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>[d] In the next verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) I have not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected the ſenſe of the LXX. who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the laſt clauſe to the flatterer himſelf: who cannot eſcape the hatred of thoſe, whom he hath ruin'd by his pernicious praiſes, or baſe compliances, with all their humours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is more fully expreſſed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence, <hi>v.</hi> 6. where I have interpreted one part of the verſe by the other.</p>

                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:99434:270"/> [e] And then ſeems to follow again, a double admonition to Princes, or thoſe that govern under them.

For when he ſays <hi>the righteous conſiders the cauſe of the poor,</hi> he ſeems to mean a <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Prince,</hi> or Judge (and ſo I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it in the Paraphraſe) for who elſe is to conſider of the
<hi>din</hi> (as it is in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>) the cauſe of the poor which is to be judged? None, but they, and the Advocates who are to plead it: all which perſons are obliged in conſcience, to ſearch into the truth of things; not to be ſparing of their pains (though matters be intricate, though the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be like to be long, though they ſhall get nothing by it) to find out the bottom of a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: which he that refuſes to doe, nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rejects the complaint of the poor, or beats them off with bugg words; or, out of the hardneſs of his heart, or the love of eaſe, or fear of great men, or any other reſpect will not give them audience, or not conſider and redreſs their grievance; <hi>Solomon</hi> pronounces him a <hi>wicked,</hi> an <hi>impious</hi> perſon; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly God will proceed againſt him.</p>
                  <p>[f] Such men indeed may ſcorn theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nay, laugh at them: but thereby they
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:99434:271"/> will endanger the bringing all things into confuſion; as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves in the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding words,

<hi>lawleſs, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> men; that regard neither God nor man, but onely their own wicked humour: which brings the Kingdom or place where they live into the greateſt danger. Which we expreſs by the word

<q rend="inline margQuotes">"It may ſeem ſtrange, ſaith he, (B. VIII. <hi>Advanc. of Learn.</hi> Chap. II.

<hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>unable</hi> perſon: but of a SCORNER. But this is a judgment moſt worthy the wiſedom of that great King, who beſt knew the cauſes of the conſervation or ſubverſion of a State. For there is not commonly the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:99434:271"/> like plague unto Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as when Counſellours, or Senatours, and ſuch as ſit at the helm of government, are by nature <hi>ſcorners.</hi> For
<hi>firſt,</hi> ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that they may win the reputation of undaunted Stateſmen, do ever extenuate the greatneſs of dangers: and inſult over thoſe who give them their juſt weight, as ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and faint hearted people. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they ſcoff at all mature delays, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted debatings of matters, by conſultation and deliberation, as a thing too much taſting of an oratory vein, and full of tediouſneſs; but nothing conducing to the ſumme and iſſue of buſineſs. As for Fame (<hi>thirdly</hi>) at which a Princes Counſels ſhould eſpecially level, they contemn it as the <hi>ſpittle of the vulgar,</hi> and a thing that will quickly be blown over. The power and authority of Laws (<hi>fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) they regard not at all; but look upon them as Cob-webs, that ought not to ſtop matters of conſequence. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> counſels, and precautions, foreſeeing of events afar off, they reject as mere dreams and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly apprehenſions. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> men truly prudent, and well ſeen in affairs, of great reſolution and counſel, they defame with gibes and jeſts.

And the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath made this very pertinent reflexion upon it (in the forenamed Book and place Parab. 3.) which it will be profitable to ſet down here.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is accounted a wiſe rule,
<hi>not to contend with our betters:</hi> but it is a no leſs uſefull admonition, which <hi>Solomon</hi> here gives us, <hi>not to contend with a worthleſs perſon;</hi> whom we cannot meddle withall, but upon diſadvantageous terms. <hi>For to overcome, is no victory; but to be conquered a foul diſgrace.</hi> And it is all one, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this contention, whether we deal ſometime <hi>in a jeſting</hi> way with him, and ſometime in a way of <hi>diſdain and ſcorn.</hi>

<hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> that hath the courage to make inquiſition after, and proſecute notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders: and, in the latter part of it, have put two ſenſes together. As I have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the next (<hi>v.</hi> 11.) where the word <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, Spirit,</hi> being differently interpreted, hath produced ſeveral expoſitions. For ſome take it to ſignifie <hi>anger;</hi> others to ſignifie <hi>words,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe of the mind.</hi> They that take it for <hi>anger,</hi> expound it thus, <hi>A fool ſhews all his anger immediately, but a wiſe man keeps it in, till he hath a fitting oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to expreſs it moſt to purpoſe.</hi> If we underſtand it of <hi>words,</hi> the ſenſe is; <hi>a fool blurts out every thing that comes in his head, but a wiſe man ſpeaks onely as much as is neceſſary.</hi> If it ſignifie the <hi>ſenſe of the mind,</hi> then this is the meaning, <hi>a fool utters all that he knows; but a wiſe man conceals many things.</hi> But the great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before named (in the ſame Chapter <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab.</hi> 15.) thinks none of theſe hit the mark.

                  <p>But none hath opened this Parable comparably to the Lord Bacon, in the place before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (Parab. 13.)
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"where he takes it for an eaſie credulous temper, in a Prince, to believe Detractours and Sycophants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination.

And therefore it is moſt reaſonable to follow our Tranſlation (unto which the wiſeſt of thoſe that adhere to the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> are forced to conſent, as moſt literal) and to look upon this Chapter as a Fragment of ſome wiſe Sentences, delivered by one whoſe name was <hi>Agur,</hi> and his Fathers name <hi>Jake:</hi> unleſs we will conceive that this Son of <hi>Jake</hi> (whoſoever he was) had gotten the name of <hi>Collector;</hi> becauſe, though he was a very wiſe man yet, he compoſed nothing himſelf: but onely <hi>gathered,</hi> out of other wiſe mens works, ſuch inſtructions, as he thought moſt profitable, and compriſed, in a few words, a great deal of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>[b] Which conjecture if it be admitted, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can better explain his diſclaiming the title of a <hi>Wiſe man</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) which he would not aſſume to himſelf, becauſe he was onely a
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:99434:283"/> 
                     <hi>Collector</hi> from other Authours, and did not pretend to have diſcovered or invented any thing himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But take it how we will, ſome of his Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are here annexed to the <hi>Proverbs of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi> after the manner of other Writings of this nature. In which (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> notes) the greater part of a Book belonging to one Authour, ſome notable ſpeeches of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been inſerted: as ſome of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byllin</hi> Verſes, they ſay, were into the Poem of <hi>Phocyllides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[c] And theſe words of <hi>Agur</hi> are called
<hi>Maſſa,</hi> which we tranſlate <hi>Prophecy,</hi> either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the weightineſs of the Sentences; or that they were culled and ſelected out of ſome work of his, then remaining in their records, as fit (in the judgment of the <hi>men of Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> who perhaps extracted them) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the
<hi>Proverbs of Solomon.</hi> And they ſeem to me to be Anſwers to ſeveral Queſtions, propounded to him by his Scholars, <hi>Ithiel</hi> (who was the principal) and <hi>Ucal:</hi> who came to him, as if he had been an Oracle, to be reſolved in ſome hard doubts: asking him in the firſt place, juſt as they did <hi>Apollo</hi> of old (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> conjectures) <hi>Who was the wiſeſt man?</hi> To which he replies,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>He that is ſenſible of his own ignorance:</hi> much like the ſaying of <hi>Socrates, this onely I know, that I know nothing:</hi> and of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who alſo refuſed the name of <hi>Wiſe;</hi>
                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:99434:283"/> which made much for the reputation of his wiſedom.</p>
                  <p>[d] <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ſubject <hi>Agur</hi> inlarges, ver. 3, 4. wiſhing his Scholars, eſpecially <hi>Ithiel</hi> (who I ſuppoſe askt the queſtion in the name of the reſt) to be ſenſible how imperfect all humane knowledge is; by conſidering how little or nothing we know of the works of God, which none can underſtand (though they be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually before our eyes) but he alone that made them. And therefore adviſes him to make it his principal ſtudy, to underſtand what belonged to his own duty (which is the beſt part of knowledge) <hi>v.</hi> 5. and herein alſo to be content with what God hath revealed; and not pretend to be wiſer than He hath made us, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>[e] After which, he gives Anſwers, as I take it, unto other queſtions, which <hi>Ithiel</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him. And firſt about
<hi>Prayer.</hi> For <hi>Agur</hi> having repreſſed their buſie humour of inquiry into all manner of things, had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we may ſuppoſe, ſome devotion in his Scholars hearts; which made them deſire to be directed in it. And he gives them moſt wiſe advice, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. to be very cautious what they prayed for; juſt as in <hi>Plato</hi> (<hi>Alcibiad.</hi> 2.) we find <hi>Socrates</hi> giving <hi>Alcibiades</hi> inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about this, as a principal part of vertue; in the practice of which, he tells him, there had need to be the greateſt care, leſt we impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ask thoſe things that are not good for
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:99434:284"/> us. But he could not give
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about this matter, as <hi>Agur</hi> here gives <hi>Ithiel</hi> and the reſt of his Scholars. Whom he informs, that the true knowledge of God is the chiefeſt good; and therefore to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in the firſt place, above all other goods: and then (according to our Saviours rule, in after-times) having firſt ſought the things that belong to Religion, he directs them to beg of God moderate deſires of all earthly things; believing that we are ſafer in a mediocrity, or middle eſtate, than either in fulneſs or in want. To which purpoſe <hi>Melancthon</hi> and others have gathered together many ſayings out of other Writers. But none have given ſuch reaſons for this choice of a middle ſtate, as this wiſe man, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>[f] After which, he ſeems to anſwer a queſtion, which
<hi>Ithiel</hi> propounded about <hi>moral vertue:</hi> which having been largely treated of by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> he onely gives him one caution againſt hard heartedneſs to Slaves, and Servants; <hi>v.</hi> 10. of which the Hebrew Nation were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very guilty: and thereby unmeet for that favour which they begg'd of God in their Prayers; which ought to have diſpoſed them to be favourable unto others.</p>
                  <p>[g] And then he gives the character of <hi>four</hi> ſorts of men, who are execrable unto God; and therefore ought to be avoided by all thoſe that would be good, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. which I muſt paſs by, without any further account
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:99434:284"/> of them, but what I have given in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe: becauſe the fifteenth verſe hath much difficulty in it, and therefore requires ſome time to be ſpent in opening it. <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks to ſolve ſome of the difficulty by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a new ſignification of the word <hi>Aluka.</hi> But all Interpreters, in a manner, taking it for that thick worm in watriſh places, which we call an <hi>horſe-leech,</hi> I do not think fit to forſake our Tranſlation: nor to refer the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the verſe to that immediately foregoing (as ſome do, in this manner;
<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors can no more leave off evil ſpeaking, than the horſe-leech leave off ſucking,</hi> &amp;c.) but rather to thoſe words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this ſame verſe; which, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I take to have ſome connexion with all the <hi>four</hi> foregoing, as I have expreſſed it in the Paraphraſe. For it ſeems to me to be an Anſwer to ſome ſuch Queſtion as this (which the Deſciples had propounded to their Maſter
<hi>Agur,</hi> after the manner of oenigmatical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, or riddles)
<hi>what is moſt unſatiable?</hi> which he chuſes to give an account of in this place; the better to repreſent the nature of thoſe wicked men he had ſpoken of before: eſpecially of the <hi>two laſt;</hi> the
<hi>proud;</hi> and the <hi>tyrannical</hi> or <hi>extortioner;</hi> whoſe deſires are a gulf, that can never be filled.</p>
                  <p>And at the firſt he ſeems to have thought but of
<hi>two</hi> things, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>grave,</hi> and the <hi>barren womb;</hi> which might be called the <hi>daughters</hi>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:99434:285"/> of the <hi>horſe-leech,</hi> becauſe they are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of the like nature, in regard of their unſatiableneſs. But he preſently adds <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> nay, a
<hi>fourth</hi> came into his mind, as no leſs greedy: <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>thirſty earth</hi> (which in thoſe hot Countries ſucks up all the rain as faſt as it falls, though never ſo much) and the <hi>fire,</hi> which devours all the fewel that is laid upon it. And this he expreſſes after the manner of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> who intending to mention
<hi>four</hi> things or more, ſeparate them at firſt, and begin with a leſſer number; and proceed then to all that they deſigned. There are many examples of it in I. <hi>Amos</hi> 3, 5, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here in this Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> VI. 16. and below in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 18,
21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed there is no example like this, where the ſentence begins with <hi>two,</hi> and then ſays <hi>three,</hi> and then
<hi>four:</hi> but that might be uſual of which we have no exact example; and therefore I do not look upon this as a ſufficient objection, againſt this way of explaining this verſe. Which the LXX. hath taken, in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Edition; which runs thus, <hi>the horſe-leech hath three belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved daughters, and theſe three are never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: and there is a fourth that ſaith not, it ſufficeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are thoſe who compare certain vices, with theſe
<hi>four</hi> unſatiable things, and not ineptly: <hi>the deſire of revenge,</hi> to the grave; <hi>libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous deſires,</hi> to the barren womb;
<hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:99434:285"/> (or rather <hi>drunkenneſs</hi>) to the thirſty earth; and <hi>ambition</hi> to the devouring fire. And it is eaſie to ſhew, how fitly all theſe are reſembled to the <hi>horſe leech:</hi> it being the vulgar ſaying, that <hi>harlots</hi> (for inſtance) <hi>are the horſe-leeches of young men,</hi> ſucking all their money from them, and exhauſting their bodies too. And the Servant in
<hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> when he was about to rob the Cheſts of the two old men ſays, <hi>jam ego me vortam in hirudinem,</hi> &amp;c. now I will turn my ſelf into a horſe-leech, and ſuck out their very bloud.</p>
                  <p>But I forbear ſuch things, becauſe there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, more neceſſary to be added for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the reſt of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>[h] And that which next follows, <hi>v.</hi> 17. is a reflexion upon the <hi>firſt</hi> generation of wicked men (mentioned,
<hi>v.</hi> 11.) who ſinned againſt the firſt Commandment of the ſecond Table (as we ſpeak) and for their rebellion againſt their Parents were adjudged to death by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> XXI. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15, 17. XX. <hi>Lev.</hi> 9. XXI. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. And to make them more deteſtable, their carkaſes perhaps were thrown into ſome lothſome places, called <hi>the valley of carkaſes,</hi> or <hi>dead bodies</hi> (XXXI. <hi>Jer.</hi> 40.) and <hi>the valley of crows</hi> (as
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartus</hi> conjectures) or <hi>ravens;</hi> whom the Wiſe man here ſpeaks of. And beſides this, they who abuſed their Parents, being of a villanous nature, were likely to turn Rogues; and to commit Robberies, Murthers, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:99434:286"/> or ſuch like horrid crimes: which would bring them to the gallows (as we ſpeak) or ſome ſuch infamous death. The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed might not ſuffer the body of one that was hang'd, after he had been put to death, to remain upon the gibbet, beyond the evening of that day, wherein he was executed. But they were not forbidden to let him lie unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, in ſome polluted place, when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down: And in ſome caſes, we find, they did let dead bodies hang a long time, as we reade 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXI. And therefore <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> (upon XX.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.) expounds theſe words of <hi>Agur</hi> after this manner;
<hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient children ſhall come to an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death, and end their days by an halter, or other puniſhment; and ſo become crows meat.</hi> But there is no neceſſity of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. For we may conceive ſuch a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon, to be <hi>drowned</hi> by the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon him; and his body to lie floating on the water; or to be caſt on ſhore, where the <hi>ravens</hi> (who frequent the waters) come and pick out his eyes; at which they are obſerved to fly, ſooner than any other part. He might <hi>periſh alſo in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> where the infamous puniſhment of the gibbet was in uſe; or be <hi>ſlain in battel;</hi> and left there to be a prey to beaſts and birds. Among which the <hi>Raven</hi> is the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſome think, becauſe the young ones are ſo impious (as <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſpeaks, L. III. <hi>de
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:99434:286"/> Idol.</hi> Cap. 85.) as to fall upon the old ones and kill them, when they are hungry (which is affirmed by
<hi>Aelian</hi> and others) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more fitly employed to pick out the eyes of undutifull Children. But I look upon this as having more of fancy, than ſolidity in it: for others, for the quite contrary reaſon, make the
<hi>Eagles</hi> here named, becauſe they are a bird full of piety; as hath been obſerved out of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> by our learned Dr.
<hi>Caſtell.</hi> whoſe diſcourſe in his <hi>Speech</hi> (<hi>in Schol. Theol.</hi> p. 31.) I ſhall here ſet down for the explication of one word in this verſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he differs from all others: which is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This word the <hi>Hebrews</hi> interpret <hi>doctrina,</hi> and underſtand the verſe thus, <hi>the eye that deſpiſeth the doctrine or the leſſon of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. But there is no known root in their language from whence to derive this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: and therefore that <hi>Doctour,</hi> out of the neighbouring languages, tranſlates it rather <hi>ſenium, old age:</hi> which is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſenſe of the place. For that which is deſpiſed by the <hi>eye</hi> is ſome corporal defect (as
<hi>crookedneſs, wrinkles, ſhaking of the head,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch like things which attend old age) not any thing belonging to the mind. And beſides, ſaith he, it better agrees with what follows of the <hi>Eagles young ones</hi> pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out ſuch an eye: for they are obſerved to bear a regard to their ancients, and to have a kind of piety in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="540" facs="tcp:99434:287"/> [i] In the next words, (<hi>v.</hi> 18,
29, 20.) he reſolves another riddle, they put to him; which was this:
<hi>what things are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and unaccountable, though ordinary and common?</hi> of which I have given the beſt explication I could in the Paraphraſe; but cannot further explain here, without making this Preface (which muſt neceſſarily be longer than ordinary, unleſs I ſhould give no account of ſeveral things in the following verſes which require explication) a great deal too much exceed the proportion which belongs to it.</p>
                  <p>[k] Next to theſe <hi>four inſcrutable</hi> things, he ſubjoyns <hi>four</hi> more, which are <hi>very grievous,</hi> or rather
<hi>intolerable,</hi> becauſe of their great indignity, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22,
23. the <hi>two firſt</hi> belong to men, and the diſturbance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; the <hi>two laſt</hi> to women, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of private Families. And there are reaſons peculiar to each: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> a
<hi>Slave</hi> is intolerable when he gets the Sceptre into his hand (as they have done ſometimes) partly becauſe ſuch perſons, being ill bred, generally have baſe principles; and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to vile things; and grow inſolent by their good fortune: partly, becauſe they are full of fears and ſuſpicions, eſpecially that they are deſpiſed and contemned; and therefore believing they are not loved, they will be feared, and care not what cruelties they exerciſe to keep men under. Part of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:99434:287"/> which the <hi>Jews</hi> object to themſelves in <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Judah;</hi> where they bring in a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher laying this to their charge, that they affecting dominion in the City of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſuch boldneſs and ſaucineſs, that they would openly ſtrike Chriſtians: which fulfilled, ſaith he, that of
<hi>Solomon</hi> XXX. 22.</p>
                  <p>[l] The like might be ſaid of the other <hi>three;</hi> but I ſhall onely obſerve concerning the laſt, that there being another way of explaining it, beſides that which is moſt obvious, I have not omitted it: becauſe the LXX. go that way, who thus render it, <hi>When a ſervant maid caſts her miſtreſs out of doors.</hi> And there is a <hi>third</hi> way, which I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, becauſe it is not ſo agreeable to the words; when the miſtreſs is not expelled, but the <hi>maid alſo is taken to wife and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the husbands love;</hi> as <hi>N. de Lyra</hi> takes it: examples of which we have in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that have proved very fatal to fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But this Preface, as I ſaid, would be too long if I ſhould name them; therefore I paſs to the next.</p>
                  <p>[m] Which ſeems to be an Anſwer to this Queſtion,
<hi>Quid eſt magnum in minimo? What is great in little?</hi> or rather in
<hi>the leaſt?</hi> v. 24, 25, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he teaches us ſeveral things: <hi>firſt</hi> not to admire merely bodily bulk, ſtrength, or beauty; but rather wiſedom, diligence and ſagacity to underſtand
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:99434:288"/> and purſue our own intereſt:
<hi>ſecondly,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wiſedom and power of God in the ſmalleſt things: and <hi>thirdly</hi> (as <hi>Melancthon</hi> adds) to reflect upon our own degenerate ſtate, who neglect our own greateſt good; nay, mind not ſelf-preſervation, but rather deſtroy our ſelves by vice and wickedneſs: and <hi>laſtly,</hi> not to refuſe admonition from the brutes. Among which, ſaith he, the <hi>Ants</hi> teach us induſtry and forecaſt; the <hi>Rabbits,</hi> not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing above our ſtrength; the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts,</hi> to preſerve ſociety by induſtry, and not to break it by ſedition and diſturbance of the publick order; and the
<hi>Spider,</hi> to endeavour to excell in ſome art or other. All of them teach us not to rely merely on ſtrength, but to uſe counſel and prudence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> of which reflexions I find in S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who diſcourſes admirably (Hom. XII.
<hi>ad pop. Antioch.</hi> p. 139.) of the wonderfulneſs of the divine artifice, which in ſo ſmall a body as that of the <hi>Ant,</hi> hath contrived ſuch a perpetual deſire of labour. To which if we attend, we cannot but receive this Inſtruction,

                     <hi>not to affect ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delicacy, nor fly from ſweat and labours.</hi> And when the Wiſe man ſends us, ſaith he, to learn of theſe little Creatures, he does juſt as we are wont to doe in Families; when the greater and the better ſort have offended in any thing, we endeavour to ſhame

(which are not ſo ſmall a Creature, as <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks of, nor make their holes in Rocks) <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath evidently proved ſignifies a <hi>Mouſe</hi> in thoſe Countries (whoſe hinder legs are longer than the forelegs) called by the <hi>Arabians</hi> in their language
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jarbuo;</hi> whoſe craft I have briefly expreſſed in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                  <p>[o] In what is ſaid of the <hi>Locuſts</hi> alſo,
<hi>v.</hi> 27. I have followed him: who obſerves that to <hi>go forth,</hi> is a Scripture phraſe for <hi>making war.</hi> In which the General was wont to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the prey among the Souldiers, after a Victory: but the
<hi>Locuſts,</hi> having no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled conſtant Commander, divide among themſelves. Yet I have not neglected our Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>[p] Which in the 28th verſe hath forſaken the ancient Interpreters, who take <hi>Semamith,</hi> not for a <hi>Spider</hi> but, for a ſmall ſort of <hi>Liz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard;</hi> from its ſpots called
<hi>ſtellio;</hi> which is accounted by all Authours a very crafty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and to which the characters here given by <hi>Solomon</hi> do moſt properly belong. As the ſame <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath ſhewn at large L. IV.
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:99434:289"/> C. 7. <hi>de Sacr. Anim.</hi> Part 1. But if any have a liſt to underſtand hereby, ſome ſort of
<hi>Spider,</hi> they may reade <hi>Coelius Secundus</hi> his little Book called <hi>Araneus:</hi> In which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the wonderfull wiſedom of God, in the ſtructure of this ſmall Creature; together with its admirable agility, and cunning; both in <hi>weaving</hi> its <hi>webs</hi> and
<hi>nets;</hi> and in <hi>hunting</hi> for its prey particularly for young
<hi>Lizzards</hi>) and in <hi>preſerving</hi> it ſelf; and its foreſenſe of dangers, and of opportunities to catch its prey: For inſtance, againſt rainy weather; when other little Creatures grow dull in their motion and in their ſight. In ſhort, he obſerves, that as there is nothing, in appearance ſo mean, ſo abject, ſo ſmall, in which the Creatour of all is not to be adored, and whoſe uſefulneſs is not very great; ſo there are <hi>five</hi> things which are admirable in that ſort of <hi>Spider,</hi> which he deſcribes: <hi>the inexhauſted matter which it ſpins out of ſo ſmall a body; the wiſedom of its contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; ſtrength in fighting; knowledge of the future; and uſefulneſs for medicine.</hi>

                  <p>[pp] And from all theſe <hi>four,</hi> ſome have noted, that an abridgment may be made of all that is neceſſary for the conſervation of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in good eſtate: where <hi>firſt,</hi> care muſt be taken for proviſion of food, which we learn from the
<hi>Piſmire;</hi> then for ſecure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious dwelling, which we learn from the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of Creature; and then that there
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:99434:289"/> be concord and agreement among domeſticks and citizens, which we learn from the <hi>third;</hi> and
<hi>laſtly</hi> that labour, induſtry and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arts be incouraged and advanced, which we learn from the <hi>fourth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[q] After the conſideration of theſe <hi>four</hi> little Creatures, of ſmall ſtrength and contemptible aſpect, he places
<hi>four</hi> other which are great, ſtately and undaunted, <hi>v.</hi> 29,
30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which there are two conſiderable difficulties; one about that word in <hi>v.</hi> 31. which we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a <hi>Greyhound</hi> (the vulgar a <hi>Cock;</hi> though <hi>Maldonate</hi> ingeniouſly conjectures the true reading in S. <hi>Hierom</hi> was <hi>Gallicus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> which afterward came to be corrupted into <hi>Gallus</hi>) but I take rather for a <hi>Horſe</hi> (as our <hi>margin</hi> hath it) being a far braver, and more ſtately Creature than either of thoſe; eſpecially when he pranſes, and is managed by a good rider.</p>
                  <p>The other is about the <hi>laſt words</hi> of the ſame verſe: which are the character he gives of <hi>a King</hi> (who perhaps is immediately placed after the <hi>He-goat;</hi> becauſe that Creature in Scripture is an Emblem of Majeſty VIII. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 21. XIV.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.

<hi>Alkum, againſt whom none ariſes.</hi> So <hi>Pallas</hi> was called by
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:99434:290"/> the Phoenicians, <hi>Ela Alkuma,</hi> the Goddeſs againſt whom none made <hi>inſurrection.</hi> And the City in
<hi>Boeotia</hi> that was ſacred to her (ſhe being reputed to be born there) was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alalcomenas:</hi> for though it was ſmall and built in a plain, yet it always remained untouched and inviolated, becauſe out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Goddeſs, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as
<hi>Strabo</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>all men abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all force and violence to it.</hi> Thus he diſcourſes in his <hi>Epiſt. quae Reſp. ad tres Queſt.</hi> p. 43. And I find he had ſaid it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his
<hi>Phaleg,</hi> Second Part, L. 1. Cap. 16. where he tranſlates <hi>melec Alcum, Rex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victus,</hi> an invincible King.</p>
                  <p>But there is another conjecture, of a very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man of our own Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> (Not. ad Gregor. Abul. Pharai. p. 203.) which is ſo patt, that I could not omit it in my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe. For, according to the
<hi>Arabick</hi> uſe of the word <hi>Alkum</hi> (out of which language both
<hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> take the liberty to expound the Hebrew words of the Bible, when they are ſingular) the ſenſe is ſtill more pregnant; and ſounds thus: <hi>A King with whom his people is;</hi> or
<hi>whom his people follow.</hi> For as when there is ſuch a happy agreement between King and people, there is nothing more comely; ſo then he appears with the greateſt and moſt awfull Majeſty, and ſtrikes terrour into all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="547" facs="tcp:99434:290"/> [r] The <hi>two laſt</hi> verſes, if we take them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the foregoing; are an advice how to be happy: which the whole Chapter ſhews in effect, is, to endeavour to be innocent. But becauſe no man can be ſo wiſe, as never to doe a fooliſh thing; he ſeems, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to tell what is next to that, <hi>viz.</hi> when we have miſcarried any way, not to juſtifie it; but to appeaſe thoſe whom we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by ſilence; taking ſhame to our ſelves, and not defending what we have done amiſs, much leſs making complaints of others,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> For (as I have expreſſed it in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe,
<hi>v.</hi> laſt) by inſiſting upon our innocence, or charging others, or exaggerating faults, very great miſchiefs may inſue.</p>
                  <p>But theſe <hi>two verſes</hi> may be connected with that which precedes; (though I have not been bold to doe it, becauſe Interpreters go the other way) and <hi>v.</hi> 32. may be an advice to <hi>Subjects</hi> if they have offended their Prince any way, and been ſo fooliſh as to oppoſe him, not to perſiſt in their errour; much leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and clamour upon the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſit down in ſilence, bewailing the guilt, and imploring a pardon. And then <hi>v.</hi> 33. may be look't upon as Advice to <hi>Princes,</hi> not to oppreſs their Subjects; and thereby provoke them to rebell againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vulgar</hi> Latin ſeems to refer both to
<hi>Princes:</hi> for thus runs the ſenſe of <hi>v.</hi> 32. according to that Tranſlation (which I cannot indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:99434:291"/> concile well with the <hi>Hebrew</hi>)
<hi>It ſometimes happens, that he who is advanced on high</hi> (to a throne ſuppoſe) <hi>appears to be a fool: who if he had underſtood</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> his danger, or his folly, or what had been beſt for him)
<hi>would have put his hand upon his mouth:</hi> that is, never have deſired that dignity, which perhaps he earneſtly ſought. And, though I know not how to juſtifie this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it agrees well with what follows (which may well be applied unto <hi>Princes</hi>) that <hi>it is great folly to ſtrain things too far.</hi> Either the <hi>Laws,</hi> which if extended to the utmoſt rigour, will, by ſuch hard conſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the bane of humane ſociety; or their <hi>taxes</hi> and exactions beyond what the people can bear. For by ſqueezing them too much, moſt dangerous ſeditions and rebellions have hapned under excellent Princes.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> underſtands the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this verſe (<hi>v.</hi> 33.) that Empires and Governments ought to be moderate; according to two excellent ſayings of <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Solon;</hi> which he alledges: and then concludes that, <hi>anger</hi> alſo ought to be repreſſed (according to the admonition in the laſt words) leſt publick diſcords ariſe, which draw after them vaſt ruins: and oft-times ariſe from light cauſes; which ought to have been mollified and cured by ſome moderation, and not exaſperated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame.</p>

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>[a] It is generally taken for granted, both by Hebrew and Chriſtian Writers, that King <hi>Lemuel,</hi> whoſe Mother gave him the Precepts contained in this Chapter, was <hi>Solomon:</hi> whom
<hi>Bathſheba</hi> took care early to inſtruct in his duty; being, as ſome of no ſmall name fancy, divinely inſpired with the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But, as all this depends merely upon conjecture, and that without the leaſt ground, ſo there is no good reaſon aſſigned why
<hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſhould here be called <hi>Lemuel;</hi> and not by the name he hath both in the beginning of the <hi>Preface</hi> to this Book, I.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. and in the entrance of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> Chap. X.
<hi>I.</hi> and of the laſt Collection alſo (XXV. <hi>I.</hi>) made by the men of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> whom <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> fancies to be the King here mentioned, under the name of <hi>Lemuel;</hi> onely for this
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:99434:300"/> reaſon, that this Chapter follows the Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proverbs made by his Servants: which hath no force at all in it; for the words of <hi>Agur</hi> follow more immediately; which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcribe to <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore it is more reaſonable to conceive this
<hi>Lemuel</hi> to have been a Prince, in ſome other Country; who had gathered ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sentences taught him by his Mother (whoſe name is unknown) which it was thought fit to adjoyn to the foregoing: becauſe they are very wiſe, and of great moment; as if they proceeded from a prophetical ſpirit. And it is onely the vanity of the Jewiſh Nation, who would incloſe all wiſedom within the bounds of their own Country, which hath made them aſcribe that which follows in this Chapter to <hi>Solomon</hi> and
<hi>Bathſheba.</hi> For which, as I ſaid, there is no colour: but it appears by the Hiſtory of the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and the Embaſſies which came from the Kings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who ſent to hear the wiſedom of
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> (1 <hi>King.</hi> IV. <hi>ult.</hi>) that there were even in thoſe times, great perſons very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive after knowledge, as there had been, in the times foregoing, in thoſe Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in
<hi>Egypt;</hi> which was famous for wiſe men, 1 <hi>King.</hi> IV. 30. where we reade of the <hi>wiſedom of the Children of the Eaſt</hi> (i. e.
<hi>Arabia</hi> where <hi>Job</hi> a conſiderable Prince, and the reſt of his Friends, lived in former ages) and <hi>the wiſedom of Egypt.</hi> Of which
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:99434:300"/> Country ſome have thought thoſe famous men to have been, who are mentioned in the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 31. where this demonſtration is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s wiſedom excelled all the wiſedom of thoſe Countries, <hi>for he was wiſer than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda,</hi> &amp;c. upon which words,
<hi>Gaſper Sanchez</hi> notes, that the <hi>Seder Olam</hi> ſays,
<hi>theſe were Egyptian wiſe men.</hi> But it is not good to take things upon truſt; for I find upon examination of the place (which is Chap. XX. of the greater Book of that name) that it ſaith no ſuch thing, but onely this, that <hi>the Sons of Zara, Zimri, Ethan, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Chalcol and Dara</hi> (mentioned 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 6.) <hi>were Prophets; who prophecied in Egypt.</hi> But however this be, that very Book acknowledges in the next Chapter; that <hi>there were Prophets in other Countries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of Moſes was given: though after the delivery of it, the holy Spirit,</hi> they fancy, <hi>forſook all the world but them; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the ſpeaking of thoſe words,</hi> XXXIII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. XXXIV. 6. For which aſſertion, as there is not the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon, ſo ſuppoſing it were true, it muſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be confeſſed that there remained ſtill among other Nations, many excellent and wiſe perſons both men and women: who had ſuch communication alſo with the Jews, that many of them were proſelyted to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which might have countenanced their
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:99434:301"/> Authours if they had ſaid (and it ſeems to me a better fancy than any they have) that <hi>Lemuel</hi>'s Mother was a <hi>Jewiſh Lady</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome Prince of another Country; by whom ſhe had this Son; and took care of his Inſtitution in the Divine wiſedom of her people.</p>
                  <p>And by the uſe of the word <hi>bar</hi> three times, for a
<hi>Son,</hi> in the beginning of this Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is no where uſed in this Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor in the whole Bible more than once, II.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.) one would gueſs this <hi>Lemuel</hi> to have been ſome great perſon in <hi>Chaldaea.</hi> For in the next verſe alſo (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) we meet with the word <hi>Melachin</hi> (<hi>Kings</hi>) according to the termination in the Language of that Country.</p>
                  <p>[b] But this is all uncertain, and therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in it: but onely note, that whoſoever was the Mother of
<hi>Lemuel,</hi> ſhe was mightily ſolicitous to have him doe well: as appears by verſe the <hi>ſecond.</hi> Which ſome think to be a paſſionate expreſſion, when ſhe ſaw him begin to incline to evil courſes; as if ſhe had ſaid: <hi>What doſt thou mean, my Son,</hi> &amp;c. But it is more likely, that it proceeded from a tender concern for his well-doing, as ſoon as ever he grew up; whilſt he was yet innocent and untainted. And that he might ſo continue, ſhe gives him <hi>three</hi> or rather <hi>four</hi> of the moſt proper Advices, that could be thought of for a Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="569" facs="tcp:99434:301"/> [c] <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſubdue that luſt, which ſhe knew to be very violent in youth; eſpecially in young Kings; who have more provocations, and are apt to take more licenſe than other men: but bring thereby ſuch miſchiefs upon themſelves, and their Kingdoms, as are not to be repaired; but often end in their deſtruction,
<hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>[d] In order to this, ſhe admoniſhes him, in the
<hi>ſecond</hi> place, to avoid drunkenneſs; and to preſerve himſelf perfectly ſober: whereby he would be fit alſo for counſel; and be able likewiſe to give a right judgment, when Cauſes were brought before him,
<hi>v.</hi> 4. which ſome extend ſo far, as to think ſhe would not have him drink any <hi>wine</hi> at all, or other <hi>ſtrong liquors.</hi> (of which there were ſeveral made, of <hi>honey,</hi> or <hi>dates,</hi> and divers other things; which go under the common name of <hi>Schechar</hi>) But it is more reaſonable to look upon it, as a caution, againſt exceſs: which is dangerous in all men, but eſpecially in thoſe that are to govern others, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For then they blurt out the greateſt ſecrets, as the Vulgar tranſlate the latter part of the verſe; or grow furious and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, as the LXX. tranſlate the ſame paſſage: but both of them without any ground that I can ſee in the Hebrew Text.</p>
                  <p>[e] In which follows, <hi>v.</hi> 5. the true reaſon of this prohibition; and then an account (<hi>v.</hi> 6.) of their condition, to whom a larger quantity
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:99434:302"/> than ordinary, of wine or ſtrong drink, is fit to be allowed. Not to <hi>Kings,</hi> who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ways to relieve their cares, and to divert themſelves when any thing troubles them: but to poor miſerable people, that are ready to faint under their heavy burthens and oppreſſions. For whom this is a preſent relief; and the onely one ſometime they are capable of; when they are in a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly condition. And they that are of ſuch a temper, or are otherways made exceeding ſad, can better bear a great deal of wine, without any diſorder, than the ſanguine; and they who are gay and merry. There are thoſe, that by
<hi>men ready to periſh,</hi> have underſtood ſuch as were <hi>condemned to dye,</hi> and <hi>going to execution.</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom it was the cuſtom to give a draught of wine, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their ſpirits; and, in the degenerate ages of the Jewiſh Commonwealth, they put ſomething into it to intoxicate the poor wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo that they might be inſenſible of pain. And ſome imagin this cuſtom took its original from this place in the Proverbs; though it be not the true ſenſe of the words. For the latter part of this verſe, (and that which follows <hi>v.</hi> 7.) gives the beſt explication of the firſt: and they ſhew he ſpeaks of thoſe that were
<hi>miſerably poor.</hi> And ſo the beſt Hebrew Expoſitours interpret thoſe words, XXVI. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. my Father was a Syrian, <hi>ready to periſh:</hi> that is, extreme poor; and in want of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="571" facs="tcp:99434:302"/> [f] And thus having enlarged this
<hi>ſecond</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice a little, ſhe paſſes to the <hi>third:</hi> which is (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) to take ſuch care that Juſtice be exactly adminiſtred (without which no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can ſubſiſt) as himſelf to undertake the defence of thoſe, who were in danger to loſe a good cauſe; for want of an Advocate to plead it for them, or to open the true ſtate of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eſpecially ſhe commends to him, the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of
<hi>Strangers, Orphans,</hi> and <hi>poor</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent people. The
<hi>firſt</hi> of which in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, are called <hi>children of change;</hi> or <hi>that are paſſed by:</hi> That is, perſons who
<hi>have changed their country;</hi> or that are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>ſuffer grievous alterations</hi> in their condition, if right be not done them; or
<hi>who are deſerted by all,</hi> and have none to ſtand by them. Several other ways there are to explain the phraſe; but to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>[g] But the great care of Parents, being to ſee their Son well married, ſhe concludes with the deſcription of ſuch a wife, as ſhe would have him ſeek: which takes up the reſt of the Chapter, from
<hi>v.</hi> 10. to the end. And it is in the form of a <hi>Poem</hi> (as S.
<hi>Hierom</hi> takes it) conſiſting of a ſort of <hi>Iambick</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: each of which begins with a new Letter of the <hi>Alphabet</hi> in order; the <hi>tenth</hi> with <hi>Aleph,</hi> the <hi>eleventh</hi> with
<hi>Beth,</hi> and ſo to the bottom. Which was an elegant ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure among the Ancients, and a great help
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:99434:303"/> to memory alſo; as we ſee in ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other parts of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now whether ſhe compoſed theſe verſes her ſelf, or got her ſenſe expreſſed by ſome eminent Poet, cannot be known; nor is it material. But I do not think fit to follow the conjecture of
<hi>Huetius</hi> (in his late <hi>Demonſtr. Evang.</hi>) who imagins the words of <hi>Lemuel</hi>'s Mother to end with the <hi>ninth</hi> verſe: and here to begin a diſtinct compoſition of ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſuppoſe
<hi>Solomon.</hi> For though this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Poem, be disjoyned from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, in the LXX; and differs herein from the reſt that in the beginning of every verſe, the order of the Hebrew <hi>Alphabet</hi> is obſerved; yet there being no words in the head of it (as there is Chap. XXX. and the beginning of this Chapter) to denote it to belong to another Authour, I take it to be of the ſame piece with the firſt nine verſes. That is, to be a Copy of Verſes, delivered to <hi>Lemuel</hi> by his Mother, in commendation of an excellent woman: which perhaps ſhe did not make her ſelf (though there be no proof of that, and both <hi>Deborah</hi> and
<hi>Hannah</hi> we find were Poets) but, notwithſtanding, being recommended to him by her; would, ſhe thought, have the ſame authority with him, as if ſhe had been the Authour. And it is very obſervable, that the general character of ſuch a woman as ſhe would have him mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is <hi>eſcheth chajil,</hi> a <hi>vertuous woman,</hi> we
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:99434:303"/> tranſlate it. Which word
<hi>chajil,</hi> ſignifies both <hi>ſtrength</hi> (or rather
<hi>valour</hi> and <hi>courage</hi>) and <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>vertue.</hi> And, in the deſcription of fitting perſons for the Magiſtracy,
<hi>Jethro</hi> in general ſaith they ſhould be <hi>anſchee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jil</hi> (XVIII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.) which we tranſlate <hi>able men:</hi> and then follows more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherein their <hi>ability</hi> ſhould conſiſt,
<hi>ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> I take therefore <hi>eſcheth chajil</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it a great <hi>fear of God</hi> (mentioned afterward <hi>v.</hi> 30.) which is ſo powerfull as to endue one with the courage to doe well, when piety is contemned; nay, laught at and abuſed: and have not therefore omitted this, among other words, to expreſs the force of this phraſe.</p>
                  <p>[h] And then follow, after this, abundance of other good qualities, which are included in this: ſuch as chaſtity; and ſuch a care of her husbands eſtate, that be might have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect confidence in her management; love to him without moroſeneſs; diligence in all houſhold affairs; frugality; gentleneſs in the government of her family; a prudent care in the education of her children; and in ſetting all the family to ſome employment or other; and increaſing alſo her husbands eſtate, and yet giving liberally to the poor; affability, and courteſie to all,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments if her Son found in a wife, ſhe knew it would be a certain means to preſerve
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:99434:304"/> him, from following other women (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) when he took perfect delight in her company: and from
<hi>drunkenneſs</hi> alſo (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) which few fall into, who intirely love their wives, and ſtudy to pleaſe them in all things: for they generally abhor this loathſome vice. In order to this ſhe would have him marry ſuch an one, as he could perfectly confide in; and never in the leaſt ſuſpect of any levity, or unfaithfulneſs, or careleſneſs, when he was abroad, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and would never be croſs to him; but always loving, and kind, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, when he was at home, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>[i] An excellent houſwife alſo; prone to take any pains her ſelf, that ſhe might give a good example to others: particularly, in the Linen, and Woollen Manufacture; in which the greateſt women, it appears by ancient Authours, conſtantly employed themſelves heretofore, with ſuch diligence, as is highly praiſed in their Books <hi>v.</hi> 13. where to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her propenſion to this work, he aſcribes a
<hi>willingneſs</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs</hi> to her hands; juſt as XXI.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 25. he makes the hands of the ſluggard, to be averſe to labour.</p>
                  <p>[k] Which turns to a great account, ſhe ſhews, both in foreign commodities, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and in the purchaſe of land, <hi>v.</hi>
16. which the good houſwife her ſelf views, and walks about with great expedition (<hi>v.</hi> 17.) tucking up her garments (as we ſpeak) that ſhe may be fit for motion every where: and not minding
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:99434:304"/> fine clothes more than her buſineſs, nor for fear of ſpoiling them, neglecting that; but preferring ſtrength in her arms acquired by labour, before the ornaments wherewith they are wont to be adorned.</p>
                  <p>[l] The profit of which ſhe finds is ſo great, that it makes her love labour better than ſleep; and when there is haſte of work, to continue it all night: ſo <hi>v.</hi> 18. may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>After which follows <hi>v.</hi> 19. another inſtance of her humble greatneſs. Then her charity to the poor, <hi>v.</hi> 20. her care of her own family, <hi>v.</hi> 21. where the laſt word having different ſenſes, I have expreſſed them all in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe.</p>
                  <p>[m] And then is wiſely mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 22. her magnificence in the hanging of her houſe, and of her bed, and in her own apparel: which was the more allowable, when the poor were not neglected; and the decking her ſelf and houſe, did not make her forget their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The particular words there I have not room to explain. Nor thoſe which follow, <hi>v.</hi> 24. (after ſhe had mentioned the honour her husband would get by ſuch a wife, <hi>v.</hi> 23.) for I think it is needfull rather to give a brief account of <hi>v.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>[n] Which ſeems not unfitly tranſlated by
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalio</hi> to this ſenſe, that <hi>ſhe being thus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply provided, and fortified, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all accidents; need not fear any want
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:99434:305"/> in future times.</hi> But conſidering what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. I have choſen onely to touch on that ſenſe; and to take <hi>ſtrength and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> for the excellent qualities belonging to her: which I have called her <hi>principal orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> becauſe the Hebrews are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that which adorns any perſon, and is moſt proper to them, by the name of <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> as CXXXII. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. <hi>thy Prieſts ſhall be clothed with righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[o] The reſt I muſt wholly omit, and onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that
<hi>the fear of the LORD</hi> in the concluſion (<hi>v.</hi> 30.) is the foundation of all theſe vertues (which will either not be found, where there is no devout ſenſe of God; or not be conſtant and equal, but vary as ſeveral paſſions govern and rule their ſpirits) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is in ſuch a high degree, that a woman values her ſelf for <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> more than any thing elſe. So the LXX. tranſlate it; <hi>A prudent woman is commended; but ſhe praiſes the fear of the Lord:</hi> which may have this ſenſe alſo, that <hi>her vertues commend Religion unto others. Religion it ſelf is honoured by her excellent vertues:</hi> which are ſo exemplary, that they make others in love with them, as well as with her.</p>
                  <p>I conclude all with the Obſervation of <hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> that this Deſcription, which he calls <hi>Speculum honeſtae Matronae,</hi> is altogether ſimple and plain, without any ſuch allegories
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:99434:305"/> as <hi>Simonides</hi> uſed, who ſaid, <hi>he was happy that married a wife like a Bee:</hi> and that all this, in a manner, is comprehended by the Apoſtle in thoſe words to
<hi>Timothy</hi> 1. II. <hi>ult.</hi> ſhe ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing, if they continue <hi>in faith, and charity, and holineſs; with ſobriety. Faith,</hi> ſaith he, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the true God, and confidence in his Son Jeſus Chriſt (that is, belief of the whole Goſpel) out of which ſprings the <hi>love of God,</hi> and from thence the love of her Husband and Children: and then <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or
<hi>ſanctification,</hi> which is that vertue we call <hi>chaſtity:</hi> and <hi>laſtly temperance,</hi> as he tranſlates it, moderation in meat and drink; or rather, all manner of <hi>ſober beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and
<hi>prudence,</hi> in the Government of the family, and in the moderation of all ſorts of expences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which things the Apoſtle particularly mentions; becauſe in the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vertues, it is the manner of the holy Writers, to name thoſe onely, which are moſt proper and ſutable to every ones ſtate and vocation.</p>
